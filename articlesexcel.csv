0,"The currency demonetization came as a surprise to people on Tuesday, with many not prepared for the immediate outcome. The Kannada industry has taken a beating, given how this short notice makes it inconvenient for many filmmakers to proceed/plan their shoot schedules. Many filmmakers were stumped with the decision, but hailed PM Narendra Modi's step to curb corruption and black money.    An industry insider says, 'It is not easy to suddenly begin working with cheques, given that the industry has always dealt with cash transactions across the board.'    Shooting of several under-production films has apparently been temporarily halted as production teams are unable to source smaller denomination notes to make payments to crew members, as well as for other day-to-day incidental expenses, including food and beverages, rentals on props like vehicles, etc.    While there is no official confirmation on this, a source at the Karnataka Film Workers and Technicians Union (KFWTU) admitted that several producers called to request that work progress as usual, with the promise of arranging funds to be disbursed as payments in the next couple of days. 'Production teams have asked for 2-3 days time to organize alternate payment options. We have given them the option to make cheque payments, which should solve the problem, but if they are dealing with black money, that is an issue,' says Chennaveerappa of the KFWTU.    Industry insiders are also saying that this could affect new films that are in the pipeline. 'There will be a lot of re-evaluation of investments from producers, as they borrow money from financiers who have liquid cash at their disposal always. Some producers will have to seek newer avenues,' says the source.    Another interesting trend could be greater investment from corporate entities in Sandalwood. 'The industry has earlier seen some big corporate names from Bollywood enter, but to no avail. This might break the monopoly of certain people and allow private and corporate bodies in Sandalwood,' adds another industry watcher.    John Jani Janardhan release pushed    The release of the Kannada film John Jani Janardhan, which was to hit movie halls on November 11, has been pushed. 'Audiences have no money for their livelihood, how will they come and watch a film? The percentage of those who would buy tickets online is minimal and we cannot risk releasing the film at a time like this. It will take some time for things to revert to normalcy. We will release the film on December 9,' says producer Padmanabha Gowda.",entertainment,,"Updated: Jan 24, 2017, 12.52 PM IST",Kannada film shoots stalled because of demonetization,,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/Kannada-film-shoots-stalled/articleshow/55332090.cms,toi
1,"CHENNAI: Travellers and tourists had a tough time at airports and railway stations while many travel agents suspended booking of tours and flight tickets on Wednesday, a day after the Union government declared Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes invalid. Though railway stations were accepting the currency, a few counters ran out of change and the absence of ATMs aggravated the issue.    Sources said foreigners who landed at Chennai and Trichy had difficulty changing dollars into the required amount of Indian rupee while those who were returning could not return the currency and buy dollars. Tourists at small towns had to face difficulty because many of the shops do not have card reading machines.    The situation at Chennai airport was better because cards are accepted for food and beverages at the terminals and airlines accepted Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes for booking tickets. However, Indigo did not allow use of the denomination for in-flight purchase and to pay excess baggage fee at the airport.    N Sadhakathulla who landed at Trichy said, ""During my travel from Kuala Lumpur, I came to know about the announcement. But I thought that we can get the required Rs 100 currencies from 'Currency Note Exchange Desk' at Trichy airport. However, we could not get the required volume.""    Those who had visa appointments had a difficult time because VFS did not accept the denomination which were declared invalid.    Travel Agents Federation of India office-bearer Basheer Ahmed said, ""Ticketing had to be temporarily stopped because of payment problem to IATA. We are also in talks with VFS to accept the currency. Today people who went to pay visa fees had a problem.""    Domestic and foreign tourists faced a tough time buying food and making purchases at restaurants and shops at small tourist towns like Ooty where many establishments do not have card reader machines and refused to accept the currency notes. In most of the tourist spots shops that sell souvenirs and local delicacies accept only cash. A few tourists missed on buying Nilgiri tea and home-made chocolates because the shops that sell these items accept cash only.    L Rakesh and Sharmila, who reached in Ooty on Tuesday morning from Hyderabad for a four-day holiday, suffered because they were strangers and shops were not accepting the money they had. Hiring an autorickshaw for visiting tourist spots became very difficult and at the end they were left with only option of walking the possible distances they could.    ""We have Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes only. Breakfast is free at the hotel so we are able to manage. But for other expenses during the day we are finding it very difficult"", he said.    Those who travelled by Omni buses did not face much problem because tickets were booked online. An Omni bus operator said, ""There was only 40% to 30% occupancy on buses of which 70% of the tickets were booked online. We accepted the currency because we did not want to turn away customers.""    The invalid notes were accepted at railway stations. But there was chaos at ticket counters at Central and Egmore because staff ran out of Rs100 notes. A railway official said, ""We gathered more liquid cash of Rs100 denomination soon after the announcement came. But that was also not adequate.""",city,chennai,"Nov 10, 2016, 01.47 AM IST","Demonetisation puts tourists in trouble, spoils plans",,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Demonetisation-puts-tourists-in-trouble-spoils-plans/articleshow/55340898.cms,toi
2,"PANAJI: Fortunes of the five offshore casino operators in Goa seemed to hang as uncertain as the ball spinning on the roulette table after news broke out of the demonetization of 500 and 1,000 notes on Tuesday night.    Casino operators were left baffled and wondering how business will continue. ""So you want to catch a thief, and to do so, you light your house on fire. The thief may be caught, but your house has been burned,"" an offshore casino operator told TOI.    Reacting to the PM's announcement on Tuesday night, chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar had said ""Casinos are likely to get affected. All those with black money will be affected. Those with clean money need not worry.""    Even though no official comments were made by casino managements, several sources indicated a significant dip in operations. While some casino operators have stopped accepting notes of 500 and 1,000 denominations, others continue to accept the scrapped currency notes up to a specified limit.    ""Our company seniors have directed us to accept 500 and 1,000 notes for now, but with an upper limit of 5,000. No one can buy chips worth more than that and this is applicable to payments also made by credit cards,"" said a casino employee, adding that winning proceeds are also paid to punters in the denominations of 500 and 1,000.    An operating head of an offshore casino said that business has been affected badly, and they have been running short of currency notes to reward winners. ""Most are unwilling to accept 500 and 1,000 notes,"" he said.    Casinos, which earn one-third of Goa's total entertainment tax, have also imposed a restriction on gamblers taking away the winning chips in order to stop them from being used to convert black money. It is also feared that state coffers may be hit by the dip in casino business in the next few months. Commissioner, commercial taxes, Dipak Bandekar said ""We are receiving information of casino operations being hit"".

4,"Nagpur: Like most parts of the country, the cities and towns of Vidarbha too witnessed chaos and panic on Wednesday due to demonetization of Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes. Those not having notes of Rs100 or lesser denomination faced problems in buying things including medicines. Petrol stations are authorized to take demonetized notes but most of them soon ran out of notes of smaller denomination and had to close down.    Various people reacted differently to the government's move. Even those viewed it favourably wished that it should have been done gradually so as to avoid inconvenience to common people.    Savita Ther, a domestic servant from Yavatmal, said, that she could not buy medicines as she did not had notes of smaller denomination. ""I had four Rs500 notes, which was given to me by my employer. I did not have notes of smaller denominations. The pharmacy shop owner simply refused to accept a Rs500 note,"" she added.    Anandrao Bhongle, a lawyer from Wani, welcomed the initiative by Modi govt to contain the black money and counterfeit notes but said that there should have been a liberal policy to enable the poor people to ensure that they could buy items of daily use.    Shopkeepers, professionals and their customers faced many problems. Dipak Bhutada, a Wardha grocery shop owner said that customers offered him only demonetized currency on Wednesday. ""As I did not have that much change my business went down by 50%,"" he told TOI.    Prakash Kahare of Chandrapur had a similar experience. ""I had little cash of small denomination notes in the morning to run my business throughout the day. Hence I entertained only those coming with notes of small denomination or those wanting to spend entire Rs500 or Rs1000 note or at least more than 80% of it at my shop.""    Dr Sachin Pavade of Wardha, said that people only offered high denomination notes. ""We refused them but as health care is an emergency service, we offered it on the promise of patients paying up later,"" he added.    Petrol station owners across the region were not so generous. In many cases they shut shop as they had run out of notes of smaller denomination. Most of the owners slammed the government for not giving them some time to arrange for small denomination notes.

5,"Nagpur: According to experts, educational institutions, particularly those imparting professional education, would be severely hit by the PM's Narendra Modi's latest move to curb the black money as most of them prefer cash from the students in case, a seat is allotted under the management quota.Moreover, parents having unaccountable income also prefer the same mode. In many institutions, especially in private medical colleges, there are cash vending machines for counting of huge number of notes, as they charge about Rs1 crore-Rs 3 crore for a single MBBS or MD seat. According to parents, even colleges running courses like BA, BCom and BSc on no-grant basis, tell them to pay half amount of fees in cash. They also extort money from the students under one or other pretext like the capitation fees, building funds and others.""Because of demonetization of Rs500 and Rs1000 notes, the only mode of payment in cash will be Rs100 notes. Paying fees will now result in accumulation of such a huge amount of currency that it will automatically hog limelight,"" feels economist Vinayak Deshpande, who is also heading Nagpur University's Business Management department.Expectedly, the college managements are not ready to come out in open about their views. However, they told TOI that their finances would be surely affected and they wouldn't have any other option than to hike the fees. The academic heads in these colleges however displayed brave face by stating that there wouldn't be any affect, as they accept the fees in cheques or demand drafts. Vice chancellor of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences (DMIMS), Dilip Gode, felt that after introduction of entrance exams like NEET, there was complete transparency in their fee structure. ""Students are admitted on the basis of merit, therefore, there is no question of donations whatsoever,"" he said.Some authorities feel that it might get tedious for students to pay the fees as they probably won't have access to the new denominations. Principal of Ambedkar College, PC Pawar said there won't be any effect on admissions. ""Demand for change will increase but overall, it's a smart move by the government which would benefit the students community ultimately in long run,"" he said.Some parents hailed the move stating that now the college wouldn't dare to ask them for donations in cash. ""Even if they demanded, we could tell them that it won't be possible for them to carry big cash. We could even lodge a complaint against them,"" they said.

6,"Visakhapatnam: With the central government announcing demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, realty sources expect that land prices may drop drastically in the next six months to one year's time. Incidentally, gold prices have shot up to around Rs 1,800 per 10 grams overnight increasing from around Rs 28,700 on Tuesday to Rs 30,500 on Wednesday. However, traders said there was not much surge in gold transactions following the demonetisation drive.According to realty sources, apartment prices may remain stagnant for the next few months, while prices of land, especially plots and bulk land, are expected to take a hit. ""In the long run, prices of layouts, plots and bulk land will witness a drop as majority of the black money is parked in the form of land. So, now with the demonetisation drive, it will be difficult for these people who have illegally amassed such assets to sell their land,"" said a prominent builder in the city on conditions of anonymity.Another builder said, ""There are two types of investments in real estate -- one in the form of built-up space such as apartments and the other in the form of plots. Most of the apartment transactions are in white as the buyers are people who avail housing loans and purchase properties from builders. The second form is purchase of plots. If the government is able to plug the loopholes successfully, then purchase of new land by the people with black money will become difficult. In the long run, it is good for prospective buyers and also builders.""Furthermore, he said, ""The main raw material for apartments is land and plots are now making up for almost 50-60% of the cost of built-up space. If land prices fall, then apartments will become more affordable for people.""However, he said, ""Once the price of property reaches a certain level, then it will remain stagnant for a while. Further escalation which is usually seen year-on-year will not be there.""Referring to the situation in and around Vizag, a layout developer on conditions of anonymity said, ""Some of the people had purchased bulk land in areas such as Bhogapuram and Sabbavaram expecting to reap windfalls due to various airport and educational projects respectively. These people had doubled the prices citing demand during the last one-and-half years. They will definitely take a hit.""Meanwhile, the Vizagapatam Chamber of Commerce and Industry welcomed the demonetisation move and said, ""There is an estimated Rs 16 lakh crore in circulation and a bulk of that is in the form of unaccounted funds. In the short term, gold price may go up as a safe haven for investment. Real estate transactions will be severely impacted due to its nature and will see a downward trend in short to middle term. However its a welcome move in the long term. This move will help flush out unaccounted, counterfeit money as well as money used to fund terrorism.

8,"KOCHI: Demonetization of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes will have a cleansing effect on the state economy, which had been affected by the flow of hawala money and fake Indian currencies from the Middle East. A thriving underground economy and relatively-high real estate prices in Kerala, compared to its neighbours, are the results of these two factors.    Top enforcement directorate (ED) officials said that the Centre's abrupt decision has left hawala networks burdened with hordes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes which they can't now offload, leaving them in a tight spot.    ""The expected liquidity crunch and tight regulations in fund transactions in the coming days would definitely make such operations difficult in the short term,"" said a top official in ED's Kochi office, adding that the black economy for hawala transactions in Kerala could be in the range of Rs 700 crore a week. The figure was calculated on the basis of past seizures.    ""It remains to be seen how hawala networks will overcome the situation and how far they have managed to convert their cash holdings,"" a DRI official said.    Geojit BNP Paribas MD CJ George said that mopping up of black money will have positive results. ""Real estate and gold were two areas people were parking black money . With the demon etisation, apartments will be less expensive and the rent will come down.It can prompt a really healthy activity in real estate sector, eventually ,"" he said, adding that black money was pushing up realty prices.    Kerala hawala links with Pakistan is no secret. National Investigation Agency's (NIA) investigations had revealed that high quality fake notes, printed in Pakistan, were smuggled to Kerala through the Middle East. And they had terrorist connections too - when NIA dug up the case of a Malayali caught in 2008 at Karipur airport with fake notes (nearly Rs 72 lakh), it unearthed Tahir Taklya, one of the accused in 1993 serial Mumbai blast case. He had got the fakes from a Pakistani named Imitiaz Ibrahim.    In another smuggling case, registered in 2013 at Nedumbassery , NIA had found that Malayali smugglers had been getting fake notes from Dawood Ibrahim's syndicate in Pakistan by paying genuine currency in exchange since 2007. NIA has filed chargesheets in nine cases related to smuggling of fake Indian currency to Kerala. In fact, five of its six cases, registered at Kochi office in 2013, were of this nature.    Though police or enforcement agencies had prevented many attempts of fake currency smuggling, a huge number of them are still in circulation in Kerala. During calendar year 2014, police seized 623 fake notes of Rs 1,000 denomination, while the Reserve Bank caught 4,616 notes from various bank branches.    In a similar way 7,202 notes of Rs 500 denomination were seized during the same period. Over the years the menace widened. In 2012, the total number of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 fake notes caught in Kerala was only 4,875.This grew to 8,975 notes in 2013 and 12,441 in 2014.",city,kochi,"Nov 10, 2016, 07.18 AM IST",Demonetisation move to curb Kerala's underground economy,,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/Demonetisation-move-to-curb-Keralas-underground-economy/articleshow/55343694.cms,toi

Perhaps after the nationalisation of 14 major commercial banks way back in 1969 by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, this is the most significant event in the economic history of India, said Norbert Lobo, associate professor and head of department of economics, St Aloysius College.    ""It is a very powerful move taken by PM Modi to curtail the black economy. No doubt, in the immediate future common people particularly from rural areas will have to face a lot of hardships. The real magnitude of these hardships will depend on the corrective measures to be adopted by the banking sector in the next couple of days,"" he said.    On the positive front, Lobo said that over a period of time, it will give a sharp boost to all formal channels of payment like banking, use of plastic money and other financial institutions that will trigger rapid economic growth. He also foresees that inflation will go down, rupee will strengthen, real estate prices will fall leading to deflationary impact in general. ""The move will also promote cashless and paperless economy in future, thereby, puts a curb on money laundering and counterfeiting and drastically reduce corruption and bribery,"" he noted.    Dharmendra B Mehta, president, Credai, welcomed the decision saying that it will give them a level playing field by insulating them from those manipulating the system with their black money. ""Most of the builders in Tier II do white transactions, so this decision will have no impact. But it will weed out fly-by-night operators who were spoiling the market. This will make the trade better and raise customer confidence and make industry truly an organised sector,"" he said.    He also said the cost of apartments may come down. ""We face pressure from land owners. Now, we can buy land directly and save costs. The land owner was exploiting the situation and making maximum out of the situation, which translates into higher cost of apartments. Because of this, land value will come down when black money goes out of the system,"" he added.",city,mangaluru,"Updated: Nov 10, 2016, 08.58 AM IST","Public affected, builders, economists welcome PM's demonetization move",,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/Public-affected-builders-economists-welcome-PMs-demonetization-move/articleshow/55344654.cms,toi

After waking up in the morning, they had to struggle to get milk, eggs and butter and kept on running from one shop to other in absence of lower denomination currency of 100, 50, 20 and 10 rupees in their pocket.    This situation arose after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs. 1000 denomination currency notes on Tuesday night.    At Birhana road, jewellers said the impact of the government's decision will be permanent. Pushpendra Jaiswal, a trader said, many traders use only cash for trading. ""We will ask most customers to make payments by card,"" he said.    Meanwhile, following the rumours of IT raid, majority of jewellery shops at Birhana road remained shut for the day.    There was a thin presence of customers at small retail outlets as most of the transactions are made with currency notes of small denominations. However, shops dealing with essential commodities in malls witnessed a good rush of purchasers making payment through debit and credit cards.    Sunil Verma, a teacher in a private school, had to return with empty hands from a grocery shop on Wednesday morning as he had only 500 and 1000 currency notes. ""Who could believe that despite having money in your pocket, you can't even buy a packet of biscuits"", he rued.    Though working at railway reservation counters was normal, but people had to face difficulty in getting lower denomination currency notes.    The private pathologies refused to accept currency notes of 500 and 1000 denominations, but in government hospitals, facilities in many departments crippled due to lack of lower denomination currency notes. The worst area affected in the medical sector was drug stores.    Large queues were seen at petrol pumps where vehicle owners were trying to do away with their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. Many people were even seen ferrying petrol in huge containers on rickshaws.    Majority of advocates in Kanpur court welcomed the PM's move. However some advocates were annoyed over difficulty that they had to run from pillar to post to obtain currency notes of small denominations as petty vendors refused to accept Rs 500 currency notes. The registry office was badly affected because due to cash deposit of registration fee there was no one to get his property registered.

""We have endeavoured our best to make as many decisions as possible through a large consensus route"", the finance minister added.

21,"PANAJI: The Union government's move to restrict high denomination notes and withdrawal of cash may well be another nail in the coffin for computer hardware retailers and smartphone sellers. The government's attempt to promote cashless transactions and demonetize high value notes serves as a double whammy for computer hardware stores.    Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement on November 8 that 500 and 1,000 notes would cease to be legal, sales at all major electronic and computer hardware retailers have hit rock bottom.    ""This move is very much welcome, but it's a challenge for computer merchandisers,"" Mandar Manjarekar of Intech Computers said.    The advent and adoption of e-commerce has hurt brick-and-mortar computer hardware stores.    Unable to compete with the massive discounts and low taxation offered by online giants, like Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon, computer retailers are forcedto decrease their margins and offer freebies to walk-in customers.    Currently, retailers profit from a 3%-5% margin on laptops, desktop computers and accessories. The adoption of cashless transactions through debit cards or credit cards eats into this margin as the retailer has to pay 1.8%-2% bank commission on each transaction.    ""If card payments are to work, there should be no bank commission for debit cards and the charge for credit cards should be less than 1%,"" Manjarekar said.    The owner of a computer hardware and accessories store said that his sales had fallen by 50%. ""I have had to turn away several customers who came in with 500 and 1,000 notes. If it is a small amount its OK, but for large amounts we cannot accept as banks will start asking questions now,"" he said.    The fear of losing hard earned money while doing online purchases ensured that computer hardware stores continued to see footfalls every month. That fear will slowly dissipate now as plastic money becomes the norm, retailers said.    Syscon Computers, which sells 4-5 laptops per day on an average has seen the numbers drop.    The Mobile Store reported a complete slowdown. ""As it is customers are few and we have to depend on talk time recharge but now even those have stopped.

It's your first personal venture in Coimbatore. Why real estate?    Indians invest heavily in three things -- education, houses and marriage. Being my native place, I wanted to invest in real estate first.    Real estate is dull in India and many completed projects in Coimbatore are struggling to sell off their units.

What do you think about the demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 currencies?    It is a bold move. I think this would pave the way for cashless transactions in the years to come. And, I see this as a big business opportunity. The country should consider investing in fintech.    India is the fastest growing economy. What according to you will be crucial to fuel this growth?    The country is known for its red tape and it often hinders administration. It takes a lot of time for the public to understand these rules which are tedious to follow. Rules are essential, but they must be simplified, like it is in America. I also think that the country should revise its tax reforms. The cap on levying income tax should be a minimum of Rs10lakh and the tax rate should be 20%.    What are areas you are planning to invest in the near future?

He said there are chances that the liquidity crunch during the crucial pilgrimage season could even impact the revenue collection at the temple.    He said that the board would request for a special permission, for it to extend the deadline for exchange of the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, through banks, from December 31 to March 31, 2017 as many temples under the board by custom have specific dates for opening their `hundis'.

24,"HYDERABAD: The state government, facing increasing pressure on its finances, on Thursday said the Centre's decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs , 1000 notes, has hit it severely.    Taking up the issue with governor ESL Narasimhan, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao expressed extreme displeasure on the matter in a nearly two-hour long meeting with the governor at the Raj Bhavan.    The chief minister told the governor that the immediate impact of the demonetisation was a whopping loss of revenue anywhere between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 2,000 crore a month.    Just in two days after the demonitisation announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, land registrations in Telangana fell from an average of 3,000 a day to 150 on Wednesday and 300 on Thursday. Similarly, against the daily average of 3,000 new vehicle registrations, the numbers fell to 1,700 and 1,100 in these two days, the CM informed the governor.    The chief minister is learnt to have told the governor that the Centre's decision is set to severely impact the real estate sector as well as excise and luxury tax collections.    Hitting out at the NDA government over tax devolution to Telangana, Chandrasekhar Rao told the governor that the state was to receive Rs 13,995 crore in 14 equal instalments of Rs 997 crore each, which was the case for the first six months of this financial year. However, this month, the Centre released only Rs 585 crore. ""Reducing tax devolution in this manner severely hurt the state government's finances,"" the CM said.",city,hyderabad,"Updated: Nov 11, 2016, 06.40 AM IST","Demonetisation hitting state hard, CM complains to government",,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/Demonetisation-hitting-state-hard-CM-complains-to-government/articleshow/55363538.cms,toi
25,"TRICHY: The first banking day following the demonetisation of Rs1000 and Rs500 notes, was a new experience for both bankers and customers in Trichy, on Thursday.    Only a few customers were lucky to fill their purses with the new currency notes... most had to return with Rs100, Rs50 and Rs10 notes.    Even before banks could open, there were long queues in front of both nationalised and private bank branches. People rushed to the banks very early in the morning, hoping to get the new notes.    ""I was doubtful they even had adequate Rs100 notes in stock. I think it will take a few more days for the banks to get the new notes. But I needed some cash today so I visited the bank this morning,"" said R Naveen from Srinivasa Nagar.    The situation was similar in rural areas too. Customers thronged the banks to exchange their cash for valid currency. They were requested to fill a special slip with details including name, identity proof, denomination and signature. The illiterate people had to depend on others to fill out their forms. In some banks there was a shortage of request forms. Thus customers had to go to the photocopy shop and get a form for Rs5.    Several banks ran dry after a few hours and had to restrict transactions to deposits only. ""We provided change for first two hours after which we had shortage of currency notes in Rs100 denominations. So, we had to entertain only cash deposits,"" said a private bank manager requesting anonymity.    Only very few people got the new notes on the first day. ""Most customers asked for the new Rs500 and Rs2,000 notes. But we are yet to receive the new notes today,"" said a cashier at a nationalised bank in Thillai Nagar. Likewise, the shortage of Rs100 notes forced some banks to give change in Rs50 and Rs20 notes. People accepted what ever the banks could give them.    Anticipating the pressure, the police had deployed personnel in almost all the banks to regulate the crowd. It was a hectic day and many banks were forced to keep open till 5pm. Since ATMs are expected to be functional from today, it would ease the crowd in banks.    City post-offices were also buzzing with activity as customers exchanged their invalid notes. In Trichy district, exchange of notes took place in 65 branches including the head and sub-post offices.    In the head post office, the customers waited in line from 10am. However, the post office administration had put up a notice board stating that customers could get notes exchanged only after noon. The banks provided notes in Rs100, Rs50 and Rs10 denominations, to the post offices to carry out the exchange process. The delay was because of the time taken to get cash from the banks. It started accepting deposits from 10am itself. As of now, the post offices have not received the new currencies.

31,"VARANASI: Of all the one liners, jokes and memes that flooded social media on Tuesday night pertaining to the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes, one of the jokes that stood out was 'Now housewives will have to reveal their black money (hidden savings) to their husbands to get the it exchanged.'    The unprecedented move of scrapping the currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denominations was not merely an assault on the black money hoarders but also housewives believed to be setting aside petty amount of cash from the total sum given to run the household. This little amount, concealed from everyone, usually grows as time passes and is used in the time of needs.    The monetary treasure stashed away in secret places have now been unveiled by the housewives as it is of no worth unless exchanged.    TOI caught up with some of the housewives who hailed the government's decision despite their lives coming to a standstill considering the impact but at the same time lamented revealing their personal savings which came handy during emergencies.    ""It is a bold and appreciable move by our government and we are all happy about it. But as housewives, we have been saving money over the lifetime for crucial days and we would obviously not want our husbands to know about it. Since these currency notes are now obsolete hence we are bound to get them exchanged through our husbands. But, we are simply hoping that our better halves would respect the cause of our savings and dutifully return the exchanged money and forget about it,"" said Savita Pandey, a housewife.    Another homemaker, Sulekha Singh termed the hidden savings as 'stree dhan' (woman's treasure) and said that it was their 'security money' to be used as and when they pleased. ""Husbands are aware of these savings because as the family in-charge we need to keep a limited amount aside to take care of needs during emergencies, she ""said.    Similar views were echoed by another housewife, Rahsmi Kediya, who lauded the PM's decision. ""As far as personal savings is concerned, everyone has their own savings but I have never hidden notes in kitchen jars or secret places so its not big a problem for me,"" she said, adding that no housewife should have savings of more than 2-2.5 lakhs as this saving is often used to buy jewelleries or for shopping.

These were the questions on most cinema hall owner's minds across the NCR when the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes was announced. When we spoke to exhibitors, they told us that there is no one clear trend. While single screens are facing losses after the move, at multiplexes, where tickets are usually booked online, the situation doesn't look as grim. This week, two films shifted their release dates, but three other films still hit the screens.

Cinema hall owners tell us that 'Rock On 2', which released yesterday and is a film that many youngsters would normally go for, could've definitely done better had it been just a regular Friday.

Exhibitors also tells us that single screen cinema halls are the most affected, as a majority of moviegoers tend to buy tickets right at the ticket counter. Hence, low-budget films like 'Dongri Ka Raja' and language films like 'Chaar Sahibzaade: Rise of Banda Singh Bahadur', which released yesterday and have a strong hold only in certain areas, are likely to see a dip in ticket sales.  Thanks to online booking, cinema business won't be affected  Multiplex owners say that the demonetization has highlighted the benefits of booking tickets online. Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR Cinemas, says, ""In the last few years, we've observed a growing trend in the online booking of tickets. Currently, 44% of our customers make online transactions, and 18% of our customers pay via debit cards, so a total of 63% people aren't paying in cash. We believe that this 44% will go up to 55%, and the total number of people transacting online will go up to 75% in the next few months.

34,"Lucknow: Union home minister Rajnath Singh on Friday categorically denied that the demonetisation decision had been taken in haste. Reacting to the Opposition parties' allegation, Singh also brushed aside the view that the government should have provided a window while implementing the ban on high denomination currency.    ""The decision was well-thought over and had a vision to it,"" said Singh, who was the chief guest at All-India Commerce Association's 69th conference at Lucknow University. Talking throughout his 30-minute speech on finance, he predicted that India was poised to become a super economic power in the next 15 to 20 years.    Drawing a parallel with China's economy, Rajnath said it was almost the same time when India got its freedom and China came out of its internal strife. Economies of both the countries progressed at a consistent pace until 1980. However, post-1980, the Chinese incumbent worked efficiently, turning the country into a global economic power, but India lagged behind and its growth rate dipped, barring between 1998 and 2004, he said. Interestingly, that was the time when the BJP-led NDA government under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee was at the helm in the country.    Since 2014, India's economy has began progressing fast with the growth rate pegged at around 7.9%, Singh said, adding that the way Modi-led NDA government is working, India's growth rate would reach the double digit mark.    Referring to the government's latest decision, Singh said that the Union government had been taking every possible step to curb the black money menace. Demonetization of Rs500 and Rs1,000 denomination currency notes was one such step. Reacting to the allegation made by BSP and SP, without taking the parties' names, Singh said that some people have been saying the decision was hasty, which is not the fact.

Similarly, another person from Gokulpeth paid Rs3.30 lakh water bill due for the last 11 years at the Dharampeth Zone office on Friday.    With the extension to use demonetized notes up to Monday, the government departments are hopeful of recovering more taxes. State government had asked all departments to give two-hourly updates on money recovered.    The Mahal person's annual property tax is Rs12,618. He had refused to pay the tax since 2008-09 despite numerous reminders. The stamps and registration department continued to incur a revenue loss for the third consecutive day.    There were many other defaulters too who were keen to pay government dues. After the state government approval, the NMC property tax, NIT, OCW, MSEDCL, SPANCO and other government departments accepted these demonetized notes up to Friday midnight.    The NMC's daily collection is usually around Rs75 lakh. On Friday, the collection rose to Rs5.48 crore till 6pm, which is a sevenfold hike.    With the counters continuing to be remain open till midnight, more moolah is likely to be raked in.    Similarly, NMC's private operator OCW used to recover water bills of around Rs30 lakh per day.

37,"MAPUSA: The government may have failed to curb matka, but the recent demonetization move has dealt a severe blow to the local form of gambling. Though matka dens continued to function across Goa, the main operator is believed to have ceased operations till November 20, due to the acute shortage of lower denomination notes.    Sources said the absence of lower denominations of currency has been making it difficult for handlers to pay out prize money to winners. While bookies were believed to be accepting 500 and 1,000 notes till Friday, winners allegedly refused to accept the currencies. In fact, several customers reportedly inquired what denomination of notes they would be given if they won, much before placing their respective bets.    Matka handlers generally accept bets for 12 different bazaars (operators), namely, 'Time Bazaar', 'Diamond', 'Milan Day', 'Rajdhani Day', 'Kalyan', 'Milan Night', 'Rajdhani Night', 'Main Mumbai', 'Main Mumbai Day', 'New Milan Day', 'News Express' and 'Malamal'.    In Goa, 'Kalyan' and 'Main Mumbai', are believed to be the most popular bazaars, generating crores of rupees in turnovers per day. People can bet money on 'Kalyan' from early morning till around 2pm. The 'open number' (first digit) is declared at about 4pm and the 'close number' (second digit) after 6.30pm. Business for 'Main Mumbai', on the other hand, begins at 6.30pm, with the 'open number' declared at midnight and the 'close number' in the wee hours of the following day. Both bazaars are closed on Sundays and some holidays.    Sources said that owing to difficulties in obtaining currency of lower denominations, the 'Main Mumbai' bazaar was shut down by its handlers since Thursday night and will likely be non-functional till November 20.

38,"NAGPUR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan to hit terrorism hard through demonetization seems to have dealt a blow to the nation's internal security threat, Naxalism, too.    With intelligence and security machineries on their toes as per plan, the Naxalites will find it difficult to launder their cash dumps containing several hundred crores. They cannot transfer such substantial cash from secret locations in the forest, known only to top ranking cadres, and exchange them for new currency at banks. A section of the security forces feel that Naxalites might make a desperate attempt through Jan militia supporters, front organizations working as NGOs, and even their cadres masquerading as villagers, to launder the money in banks where they have presence.    Sources in the banking sector said there have been huge deposits in Gadchiroli district. The accounts which received substantial deposits are bound to be scrutinized. Inspector general of police, state Anti-Naxal Operation (ANO) cell chief Shivaji Bodkhe said close surveillance is being kept near banks and other financial institutes in Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Gondia and Bhandara districts.    ""The security forces have been alerted and checks are being conducted to intercept unaccounted cash. The banking sector too has been taken into confidence to share information about suspicious deposits and questionable flow of cash into any account,"" said Bodkhe.    Sources in the security agencies claimed that unaccounted cash Rs1,500 crores, amassed by the Naxalites, may be left stranded as security agencies are keeping a close eye on the movements in and around the affected regions. In Central India's hinterlands, controlled by the Naxalites' Dandakaranya special zonal committee (DKSZC), it is estimated that around Rs50 crore may be at the disposal of the rebels. The cash collection from Gadchiroli, Maharashtra's most affected part in eastern Vidarbha, which is also under DKSZC, is around Rs25-30 crores.    Inspector general of police, Nagpur range, Ravindra Kadam said that the demonetization would hit urban networks of Naxals adversely. ""The urban cadres depend upon their rural counterpart for monetary support, which would be affected,"" he said. ""Another problem for Naxalites is that most of their money is dumped in secret places, from where ferrying the cash at such short notice in such tight surveillance is not easy,"" said Kadam.    Security agency sources claimed that extortion from civil contractors, traders and business houses, including mining companies, get the most party funds for Naxalites. In Gadchiroli, tendu leave collection contractors and bamboo cutters share substantial amount as funds. The Naxalites also collect party funds from tribal population through a scheme 'work-a-day' in which the rebels claim one day wage from the workers.    Superintendent of police, Gadchiroli, Abhinav Deshmukh said the problems for Naxals are a logical outcome of the demonetization process.

39,"Visakhapatnam: Much to the dismay of online businesses and tech startups offering various services in the Port City, the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has hit business in the last couple of days.    Even though online services have the option of payment through debit or credit cards, net banking or digital wallets, online businesses said they have suffered a drop in business as majority of the orders are usually based on cash-on-delivery option. Apart from startups offering services such as household repairs, even those supplying groceries too have taken a hit due to the demonetisation drive.    ""We used to get around 20-30 orders on an average and majority of these were cash-on-delivery orders. In the last two days, we received only about 5-10 orders which were made through card payment,"" said a representative of Quick Pebbles, which deals in household services such as plumbing and repairs of electrical devices. ""Most of our workers belong to the unorganised sector and the value of the work is known only after it is completed. So, we prefer to take cash after completing the job. Due to this demonetisation, people don't have smaller denominations to offer and we are not receiving any orders,"" he added.    Another startup involved in supply of groceries and food commodities too faced a similar issue. ""About 70 per cent of our orders are based on the cash-on-delivery option. We are now facing an 80 per cent drop in orders. Unlike the bigger funded startups, we can survive only if we have a daily flow of orders,"" said a member of Vizag-based startup UrbanBasket.    Meanwhile, cab aggregators too have stopped taking Rs 500 notes due to which customers are shying away from ordering cabs for daily travel. ""Usually, we have around 10-12 trips per day, but on Thursday and Friday, I was hardly able to get one or two rides.

40,"KOLKATA: Who is right  Modi or Mamata? Opinions are divided. While the public initially hailed the Prime Minister's stance to wipe out fake notes and curb black money, the liquidity crunch in the last two days, the queues at banks and the harassment have resulted in a swing in the public mood. Those who initially winked at Mamata Banerjee for her barbs against the move can't discount her anymore. Most of them are the nuts and bolts of the robust cash economy running in the country (including black money) that far outnumber those who operate through banks and opt for electronic money transfers.    Even BJP president Amit Shah has been forced to take note of Mamata's views. ""I have heard that Mamtaji has also opposed this. But what I fail to understand is that this scheme is against blackmarketeers, hoarders and terrorists. This has nothing to do with the poor. Instead, it is for the benefit of the poor. I don't know whose cause Mamtaji is espousing,"" Shah said at a press meet in New Delhi.    On the ground, the salaried middle class, the pensioner and the small trader are slowly running out of patience due to the inadequate financial infrastructure. Bank officials working overtime to cater to this huge crowd are running short of cash. Mamata is trying to address this crowd in a language it understands. ""The Modi government has led an assault on the lakshmir jhapi,"" Mamata said on Thursday, pointing to the plight of the vegetable vendor or tea garden worker who sustains his family on the daily income. Now political parties  Samajwadi Party, BSP, AAP and even Congress  have joined in protest of the move. Mamata's arch rival Left had announced that the demonetisation can at best target only a small portion of the black money without touching the big fishes. Mamata is thus upping her ante with an eye on the millions catering to the cash economy because numbers count in democracy. ""While doing so, she is taking care of party-dominated syndicates and party men who have back money acquired through chit funds,"" said CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra.    The criticism apart, the Trinamool chief is slowly consolidating her support base and trying to win back the small traders who went with BJP in the last assembly polls.    As of now, Mamata has with her at least 90-odd members across political parties to raise a ruckus in Rajya Sabha.    Left, too, can't stay away from the debate. ""We have a consistent view against black money and have a corrective proposal. We will express our view in Rajya Sabha in case of a debate,"" said CPM leader in Parliament Mohammad Salim.

He alleged that the whole move was a huge scam by the NDA government and that the BJP and some other players had been given prior information of the move.    ""A huge scam has been perpetrated a few days ago in the name of tackling corruption,"" Kejriwal alleged. ""When the PM announced the move, he had informed all of his friends who had black money and they secured their money,"" the Delhi CM added.    He further alleged that there had been significant misreporting on the money deposits made at banks. ""In previous quarters, deposits in banks were negative. But in the July-to-September quarter, such large amounts were being deposited in the banks. Who did all this money belong to?"" he asked.  2 die in queue to exchange banned notes at bankThe scramble by millions of panicked consumers to exchange banned currency or deposit them turned tragic today when two people died in separate incidents in Maharashtra and Kerala amid chaos and confusion for the second straight day with poor cash flow.  ""They are claiming that a lot on money will now come into the system. In the name of battling corruption, the only thing that is going to happen is that a lot of money is merely going to change hands. And for this, the people are being inconvenienced"" Kejriwal said.    ""The government has said those who deposit their black money will have to pay tax and face a 200 percent penalty. That means 90 percent of the amount will be lost. Which holder of black money is going to make such a deposit? The government is indirectly trying to tell black money holders not to deposit their money,"" he alleged.    He continued his attack on the 'intent and implementation' of the move.

45,"BENGALURU: ATMs running dry, serpentine queues at banks and post offices, bank staffers working overtime - this is but a short list of grievances being aired by the urban elite and middle classes, inconvenienced by the Centre's move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.    But, one facet of the move that could easily slip under the radar is that 40% of India is outside the ""Ambit of formal banking"", that is they are without a bank account, as conceded by the Centre on June 1, 2016. The 'invisible' 40% can exchange money up to Rs 4,000 just once, until the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reviews the decision a fortnight from the day the Prime Minister made the announcement (Tuesday).    ""The decision will be renewed in 15 days. Until then, yes, we have allowed people to exchange only once,"" RBI spokesperson Alpana Killawala told STOI from Mumbai. She was, however, quick to point out that people could withdraw a maximum amount of Rs 10,000 in a day, and up to Rs 20,000 in a week, albeit from their bank deposits. But, such options don't exist for those like 68-year-old Muniyamma - a single woman with a broken left shoulder, struggling to make ends meet every day - who has no bank account.    A resident of Ulsoor in east Bengaluru, Muniyamma is a domestic help, whose husband left her 47 years ago, and is childless. ""I have saved up nearly Rs 20,000 over many years. I never knew how to do bank work, so I never had an account. I've had no need for one, and now I am stuck with all the cash, but can't use it to buy supplies,"" she said. Although she managed to get her hands on some cash at a government hospital, where she got her arm treated, that has now run out.    According to a study conducted by consulting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers' in October 2015, a whopping 233 million Indians have no bank accounts, which means that many citizens are likely to be faced with a predicament not unlike Muniyamma's.    Furthermore, a United Nations (UN) report released around the same time highlighted that 43% of the adults with bank accounts made no deposits or withdrawals in the 2014-15 period. Pillamma Thippaiah, 67, who created a bank account with her neighbour's help to register for a widow pension scheme that never materialised, is a case in point. ""I have some money saved up, but it is in cash at home, since I didn't know how to deposit it in the bank,"" Pillamma said.    The plight of Pillamma and Muniyamma in the country's IT Capital serve as indicators to the crisis that the thousands of men and women without a bank account, are likely to be confronted with in the wake of demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes.    Further, a United Nations (UN) report released the same time, points out that 43% of adults with an account made no deposits or withdrawals in the past year. The cases in point here are people like Pillamma Thippaiah, 67, who created a bank account with her neighbour's help to register for a widow pension scheme that has never materialised.    Responding to a specific query about problems likely to be faced by those without bank accounts, Killawala said, ""They can visit the post office and exchange their money."" When asked what they would have to do in the event of needing more than Rs 4,000, she said, ""Do small people want to use more than Rs 4,000? Do they have that much money?""    Reiterating the fact that RBI had factored in all probable issues into account, she added, ""This (exchanging Rs 4,000) is not a life-time offer. We will review the situation in 15 days, and in all likelihood, it will be allowed again.""    Economist and professor at Indian Indistitute of Management-Bangalore (IIM-B), Charan Singh admitted that there were bound to be difficulties for those without bank accounts. However, he pointed out that the merits of the move were greater than the hardships the citizens are experiencing. ""I completely understand the inconvenience faced by the people, but I stand behind the move since its merits will be greater.

Referring to the deaths, which are believed to have been caused by the ongoing cash crisis and the long queues at ATMs, Kejriwal said that the Centre's move was a ""surgical strike"" on the common man's small savings and not a crackdown on the black marketeers.    Addressing a press conference on Saturday, the CM questioned the ""intention"" of the ruling dispensation behind the decision and alleged that it was a ""deliberate"" attempt to create chaos. ""As a result of this tip-off on demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, there was a massive rise in the amounts of deposits in several public sector banks over the last quarter,"" Kejriwal alleged.    He cited a TV channel's report which pointed out the ""stunning growth in deposits, in contrast with the negative growth in deposits recorded in the previous quarters"". ""From July to September, there had been a sudden jump in deposits of money in banks, which clearly indicates that BJP had told its friends much before the announcement by the PM. In the name of fighting the black money, a huge scam is operating in the country,"" he said.

Crores of rupees had been deposited in banks during July-September quarter at a massive level. However, some people would attribute that the huge deposit were done because of recently-concluded I-T declaration scheme, the CM said.

50,"They say that to engineer and execute a major economic stunner, you need a few Guja ratis. While the Gujarati connection of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and current RBI governor, Urjit Patel, is quite evident in the ongoing demonetization drive, three Gujaratis had executed a similar surgical strike on black money, 38 years ago, in 1978.    The new Janata party regime led by PM Morarji Desai had just stormed into power riding on the popular wave against corruption and nepotism of the Indira Gandhi-led Congress party soon after the Emergency. On January 16, 1978, Union finance minister H M Patel, went on air at 9 am to announce demonetization of Rs 5,000, Rs 10,000 and Rs 1,000 notes.    H M Patel was a native of Dharmaj in Anand. Then Prime Minister Morarji Desai belonged to Bhadeli in Valsad, while the then 14th RBI governor, I G Patel belonged to Palana village in Gujarat's Kheda district -the same place from where the current RBI governor, Urjit Patel's family , hails. Interestingly, both these RBI governors had to execute the task of demonetization within two months of assuming office.    A striking similarity between the two demonetization drives is that both took off just a few months prior to assembly elections in seven states.    Back in 1978, there were elections in AP , Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Meghalaya and Mizoram, starting from June 1978. The current demonetization drive is taking place when there are assembly elections scheduled for Goa, Manipur, Punjab, Uttarakhand, UP , Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh starting in 2017.    In his memoirs, 'Glimpses of Indian Economic Policy', I G Patel admits that he went along with demonetization `reluctantly'. Patel claims in his book that he had pointed out to the finance min ister H M Patel that ""People who have black money on a substantial scale rarely keep it in cash."" The present RBI governor, Urjit Patel, restricted himself by saying, ""RBI has been concerned about the growing menace of fake Indian currency notes which has been increasing in numbers.""    In Gujarat, during the two days of the 1978 drive, Surat had emerged as the district with the highest deposits of demonetized notes.    An SBI bank official is quoted in a TOI report (March 10, 1978) that 6,250 people had deposited notes worth Rs 2.77 crore.    Surprised at a large number of donations to temples, trusts and institutions in Gujarat, Union finance minister H M Patel undertook a tour on January 19, 1978 to warn that institutions accepting donations in high value demonetized notes should prove that they had received them before the government had passed the ordinance. The impact was felt in most markets--diamond, bullion, and dyes and chemicals - where use of unaccounted high denomination notes was substantial.    On January 20, 1978, TOI reported that there were long queues outside 16 collection centres in Ahmedabad even till 6.30 pm and some Rs 20 lakh was collected during that time. It was also alleged that in Bhadra and others areas Rs 1,000 notes were being offered for Rs 200 and yet there were no buyers. Bullion traders claimed that demonetization had pushed gold prices up from Rs 692 to Rs 710 per 10 grams.    Allegations of ""leaks"" ahead of the demonetization drive had flown thick during the Morarji regime as well. Former PM Indira Gandhi, during a press meet in Bangalore in February 1978, had said, ""People in `certain circles' knew about the step well in advance and had got high-value notes exchanged."" When a TOI correspondent asked her how much money she had lost after demonetization, Indira shot back: ""I have nothing to lose.""    Indira was seconded by former finance minister C Subramaniam, who said that rival netas were the real targets.",city,ahmedabad,"Nov 13, 2016, 06.55 AM IST",Great Indian demonetizers made in Gujarat,,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Great-Indian-demonetizers-made-in-Gujarat/articleshow/55395206.cms,toi

Addressing media here on Saturday, Shabbir Ali said the NDA government's late-night decision to demonetize Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes had hit the common man hard. ""Thousands of people have been queuing up outside banks to exchange the old notes. They have been put to hardship for no fault of theirs.

52,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPI on Saturday hit out at the Centre over the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes, saying it was a bid to cover up Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""failure"" in reining in black money.    The demonetisation policy of the BJP-led NDA government will not curb black money as it continues to exist in the forms of gold and stock exchange deposits, CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran said.    Addressing a 'meet-the-press' programme organised by Kerala Union of Working Journalists here, he denied BJP leaders' allegation that black money to the tune of crores of rupees had been stashed away in cooperative banks in the state.    ""Will demonetisation help in putting an end to blackmoney? Then, what is the means to regulate illegal money in the form of gold and stock exchange deposits?"" Rajendran asked.    ""Modi has been saying for the last two years that he will bring back black money stashed abroad. But, he failed to fulfill his promise and the present demonetisation was an attempt to cover up his failure,"" he charged.    Referring to BJP seeking a probe into money deposited in cooperative banks in the state, the senior CPI leader said the propaganda was part of a calculated move to destroy the cooperative sector, ""a backbone"" of the state's economy.    ""Cooperative banks are being operated with the license of Reserve Bank of India. Cooperative institutions are backbone of the state's agrarian sector and play a crucial role in the state's economy,"" he said, adding that like Kerala, such institutions were significant in Gujarat also.

53,"In 12 hours, there couldn't have been a starker difference to jeweller Hansraj Mehta's fortunes. At 9 pm on November 8, just hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, his store in north Mumbai was besieged by customers buying all that was available, paying with wads of currency, seeking to convert cash into more agreeable holdings in gems and jewellery.    The next morning was just the opposite  an almost empty store, with barely a dozen walk-ins and just a couple of low-value purchases. ""There's lots of cash floating around and people are now scared they will lose their money in this fight against black money,"" says Mehta. ""We expect to be back in business next week.""    For the next couple of days, the bustling market where this store is located  and thousands across the country  where cash is the primary source of income, will see business dealings plummet. From Zaveri Bazaar in Mumbai to Sadar Bazaar in Delhi and Krishna Rajendra Market in Bengaluru, businessmen sweated on the fate of their enterprises.    A dealer of PVC pipes in the Bengaluru market, who bills Rs 1.5 crore a month and is dependent on cash for 80% of his payments, spent most of the week waiting for customers. ""In three days, I had barely 10 customers walk in and of those just five made small orders,"" he grumbles.    Across the country, businessmen saw the rise and fall of their enterprises. Nikhilesh Dhawan's business too took a pounding. A Samsung dealer in Jagatpuri in Delhi saw just three or four customers making purchases a day after the big announcement, paying by cheque; in happier times, 80% of his purchases were in cash. About 10 km away, in upscale Khanna Market, Rajesh Luthra, promoter of RK Vision, a consumer electronics store, sold goods worth Rs 31 lakh until midnight, doubling his daily sales.    Otherwise fussy customers bought air purifiers, refrigerators and LED televisions in a tearing hurry to dispose of their cash. After that storm, a lull quickly descended on Wednesday, with barely 15 bills raised, compared with over 100 on a normal business day.  Honey, Have You Shrunk the Money?  As businessmen, heavily reliant on cash, fretted about their wildly swinging fortunes, most people on the street spent much of Thursday and Friday standing in queues trying to get their hands on these new notes or figuring out how to manage with the limited, legal currency at their disposal. Pradeep Kumar, a painter in suburban Mumbai, spent three hours on Thursday evening and a couple more on Friday before being able to finally withdraw money to pay his dues.    For all of Wednesday, Kumar managed with Rs 60, before empty pockets compelled him to queue up. ""This is a disservice to the poor who have to waste hours during a work day hunting for money,"" Kumar says.    This pain is amplified away from big cities. In the small town called Ezhukone in Kerala, about 20 km from Kollam, Anitha Radhakrishnan, a 59-year old retired employee, uses cash to pay for her daily milk, vegetables and fish. Following the sudden demonetisation, she was left with Rs 259, with which she had to manage all her immediate purchases, with neither her neighbourhood grocer nor the pharmacist wired to accept cards or digital payments. To make ends meet, she pleaded with an auto driver to ferry her to and from the chemist to buy medicines she and her husband urgently required.    She held on to her last few tenners and a desperate hope that the ATM-less Wednesday would pass without incident or emergency.  Hoard Unlimited  If Radhakrishnan spent her time wondering how to manage with little cash, Manish Kumar (name changed), in his cramped office in the Mumbai suburb of Andheri, is wondering how to dispose of the cash he has hoarded. An agent for the local road transport office, he keeps up to Rs 5 lakh in a locked cupboard in office and more at home. He has managed to buy some jewellery and electronics goods, but faces tough choices ahead. With fixed deposits over Rs 2.5 lakh facing tough scrutiny, that's another avenue shut, for now.    Away from the chaos of managing too much or too little cash, experts divided on the efficacy of the long-term game out black money and counterfeiting of high-value notes. ""It will tackle black money, corruption, terror money and counterfeiting  multiple with one stone,"" Shah, chairman of financial services company. ""I call it gutsy because it's a move that any political party will know will be difficult and there will be plenty of reasons not to implement.""    Dhruv Phophalia, MD with Alvarez & Marsal, a management consultancy, calls this a great one time action to cleanse the system. While this is a great first move, the Modi government needs to do much more to back this up. ""Thus requires several follow-ups, especially tightening and better enforcement of PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) and deterrence in the form of far stricter punishment to be effective.""    A clampdown on black money may be meaningless with this one-off move. While this may serve as a strong notice of intent, the government faces a series of difficult choices ahead, targeting large sectors such as real estate, which are flush with these funds. ""It is important to ensure the chain of black money doesn't return,"" says Mritunjay Kapur, partner, KPMG India, a management consultancy. In the longer term, to achieve this, the government needs to build on a range of initiatives, including GST, access to bank accounts with initiatives such as Jan Dhan and technology enablers such as Aadhaar, to make a fist of its fight against black money.    If the demonetisation has been a bigbang announcement with some immediate repercussions, it may take more gumption in the long term to strike a body blow in the fight against black money and indeed counterfeit currency. This is because a large chunk of this illicit money is squirrelled away in the form of real estate and jewellery or even overseas, away from the prying eyes of regulators. ""People with malicious intent usually catch up with these changes and are quickly go one step ahead,"" says Reshmi Khurana, managing director, Kroll India, a forensics specialist.    ""As India moves more towards a 'white' economy,' liquidating holdings overseas and stamping out counterfeiting, which thrived on operating in a cash-rich economy, must be key long-term goals.""

54,"NEW DELHI: Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his announcement to demonetise currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 to fight the plague of black money earlier this week, tempers have been flying high. There have been reports of chaos prevailing in some parts of the country and even deaths occurring.    A child recently succumbed because a doctor refused to attend to him because his parents had only Rs. 500 notes that have been declared no longer legal tender.

He has alleged that the meteoric rise in the sales of Patanjali products is not due to anything else but the BJP's money.    His tweets have incited divided reactions, leading many to claim that Modi's fight against black money is causing unprecedented inconvenience to the ordinary citizen. Some say it's a totally bureaucratic tactic.    Reportedly, the cost involved in the demonetisation of the old currency and replacing them with new ones will be less than the black money being checked.

59,"NEW DELHI: Government's move to demonetise currency will impact the secondary steel sector as most of the business conducted by these mini mills and rolling factories is cash-based, which in turn would help the large producers, Tata Steel said.    Counted among the top 10 steel makers globally, the Mumbai-based firm said that demonetising will also temporarily impact steel demand in rural India as the business there is also mostly cash-based.    ""We are watching secondary sector very closely because a lot of that business used to happen on cash. And maybe 60-70 per cent of the long products business is actually driven by the secondary sector.    ""So it could have a significant positive impact on the long products business for the integrated or bigger players,"" Tata Steel India and South East Asia Managing Director T V Narendran said in an investor call last week.    Government demonetised Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes from the midnight of October 8 with the aim to fight black money and corruption.    ""But in any case, market was shifting towards integrated sector because between JSW Steel, Tata Steel, RINL and JSPL and everyone else, lot more long products capacity is being added over last few years, which is encouraging the consumer segments to shift towards formal sector. But, demonetisation move should accelerate that process,"" Narendran said.    The secondary steel sector, which accounts for almost half the steel produced in India, uses sponge iron and scrap to make steel in small induction furnaces.    These producers generally procure sponge iron feedstock from nearby manufacturers and sell crude steel, mostly pencil billets and ingots, to re-rollers.    India, the world third largest steel maker, produced 89.58 million tonnes of the metal in 2015.    Tata Steel is also witnessing some impact on logistics as some movement of material got disrupted due to ""confusion at the toll gates and excise points"" which is getting ""sorted out"", Narendran said.    ""Rural demand, which is largely cash-based, will get impacted temporarily. Our dealings with our distributors are largely on RTGS and the dealings of our distributors with their dealers is largely on RTGS. Its only the final consumers who tend to pay cash,"" Narendran said.    He further said: ""So there could be some sort of hiccups there for sometime. But, I don't think, we see it as a big issue over a long period of time. We are interested to see what's happening in the real estate markets and the impact it will have there.

Megastar Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and Karan Johar have lauded PM  Narendra Modi for doing away with the high denomination notes, calling it a masterstroke in India's war against corruption. When asked what he would like to say on demonetisation, Hrithik told reporters here, ""Nothing right now.""  This superstar called up Hrithik Roshan to congratulate him on Kaabil trailerHrithik Roshans Kaabil has been making waves ever since the films trailer was released last month.  He was speaking at the launch of a single by Ananua Birla, daughter of Kumar Mangalam Birla, yesterday. Also present at the launch were Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Prasoon Joshi, Rahul Bose, Shaina NC, Rannvijay Singha among others.    Prasoon, who was forthcoming in speaking on the currency demonetisation, said, ""When this decision was made, I am sure there was a smile on those people's face who have worked hard to earn money.    ""There will be some inconvenience for a few days but if such steps are not taken, it will become difficult to bring any change in the country. I am among those people, who have nothing to worry about because we have led a clean life. So, we should welcome this move."" Chopra also praised the government's decision, calling it a ""good step."" The new development has also caused inconvenience to the citizens in terms of cash deposit and debit.    Reacting to the criticism by other parties, Shaina said, ""It is important to understand the the Prime Minister has taken a decision which is in the interest of all. ""We do away with terrorism, fake currency. It may be inconvenient for a few days but look at the larger picture, it is inclusive for all Indians...""    While most the the film industry has given a thumbs-up to the PM for this move, actor Arshad Warsi, is among those, who are not very pleased with the development. Warsi hit out at the PM in a series of tweets, asking him to make new laws and amend the older ones that don't allow fraudulent companies to function at all and increase the number of tax payers in the country.\  Hrithik Roshans Kaabil teaser out01:00Movies' first look1534Movies' first lookBollywood actor Varun Dhawan shared the first look of Bollywood film Badrinath Ki Dulhania, sequel to Humty Sharma Ki Dulhania, where he is seen kissing his co-actor Alia Bhatt.

61,"MUMBAI: Private sector Axis Bank expects a dip in lending rates because of the surge in deposits which lenders are experiencing in the aftermath of the government's move to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.    ""The deposits are into savings or current accounts which are low cost ones. An increase in them should bring down our cost of funds,"" Axis Bank's Head of Retail Banking Rajiv Anand told PTI.    ""The decrease in cost of funds should bring down the lending rates over a period of time,"" he added.    The comments will come as good news for the millions of harried people who have been queuing up outside banks to either deposit the scrapped notes or withdraw accepted tender for meeting their daily expenses in a predominantly cash economy.    Banks have introduced a slew of relaxations for making it easier for the customers, including extending the banking hours and keeping branches open on the weekend.    According to a report, Rs 60,000 crore was deposited into accounts till Friday evening, which will only ride up with time.    Domestic ratings agency Icra has said that it expects a 0.03-0.10 per cent dip in the cost of deposits in the near to medium term because of the surge. This reduction can be passed on to borrowers through a cut in the marginal cost of funding based lending rate.    The potential deposit opportunity is Rs 13.5 trillion, but the actual growth will not be as much as some parts will be exchanged for new notes and drawn for meeting daily needs from time to time, it said.    Despite this, the rating agency said it sees an increase of 1.3 per cent to 3.5 per cent in the total deposit base of the system.    In a surprise move, Prime Minister Narendra Modi last Tuesday announced that his government has decided to demonetise the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes to curb the menace of blackmoney and counterfeiting.

Youth Congress volunteers will help people, especially senior citizens, to fill forms for note exchange and provide necessary information.

72,"BHOPAL: As anger intensifies in the country with banks struggling to dispense cash following the government's quick decision to withdraw Rs 500 and Rs 1000 denomination notes, whistle-blower of the infamous Vyapam scam - Prashant Pandey - is worried for nearly Rs 10 lakhs seized from his wife by police a year ago. Currencies were in Rs 500 denominations.    He has moved an application before Indore court praying for an urgent hearing on the matter so that the notes in police custody can be swapped or exchanged with new currencies.    ""They have neither proved that seized money was 'black' nor have they returned it to me. By the time they will decide over it, deadline for exchanging the notes would be over and my money would become worthless"", Pandey told TOI.    His wife Meghna was rounded up with a sum of Rs 996000 from an office near Nehru stadium at Indore in a joint operation led by state's intelligence unit and local crime branch on July 26, 2015. It was alleged to be a well-planned strike against the bond fan after he sought to topple chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.    Prashant argues that the seized money was meant to buy a house and police took a vindictive action to harass him. However, police still maintain they had specific intelligence inputs on cash being delivered to his wife through 'hawala'. Money was seized under Section 102 of CrPC (power to seize any property which creates suspicion of the Commission of any offence) after she failed to give a satisfactory explanation, said police. Meghna lives with his parents and two children in Indore while Prashant has shifted to Delhi citing threat to his life.    Police officials privy of the case say that the seized money can be handed over to him on 'supurdigi' (a legal term for giving a sub judice property in someone's custody by court). This means Prashant can keep the cash with him, but cannot swap or exchange it until case is decided.    Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced demonetization of Rs 500 and 1000 currency notes with effect from midnight, making these notes invalid in a major assault on black money, fake currency and corruption.",city,bhopal,"Nov 13, 2016, 05.05 PM IST",Demonetisation of Rs 500: Vyapam scam whistle blower pleas to swap 'seized' cash,,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/Demonetisation-of-Rs-500-Vyapam-scam-whistle-blower-pleas-to-swap-seized-cash/articleshow/55400502.cms,toi
73,"THANE: The demonetization of high value currency has stirred a national debate with people taking positions guided by their perceptions on politics and economics. TOI talks with Dr Avadhoot Nadkarni, retired Director of Economics, University of Mumbai, who has lauded the move, but is not entirely convinced it would eradicate corruption completely.    Q) The demonetization has taken the nation by surprise. Do you think it will achieve its target of weeding out black money and corruption?    A) The sudden withdrawal of high value currencies is definitely one step in the right direction. We must understand that the real fight is against undisclosed income which is often converted into assets like gold, real estate. It would be too early to make a comment on whether the entire bulk of black money or cash would be unearthed. By a cursory estimate nearly 50% of the unaccounted cash could be retrieved while the others could escape through the system. Corruption and hoarding could return unless you take strong steps.    Q) Does this open a window for a parallel economy and will the aam aadmi be exploited in the bargain?    A) There is a possibility of a parallel system in place that accepts the old notes in return for a commission. Few business units like restaurants or entertainment centres could end up as channels for parking the money in banks as there is no legible time frame for doing so. They can easily deposit money stating that it is from a transaction done a day before the notes were banned.    Q) So does it mean the plan does'nt net the big fishes?    A) A notable segment involved in corruption including the businessmen tend to convert their cash into commodities. A lot of time limit has been given that will be exploited by those hoarding cash to convert the stash from black to white. The real test will be to introduce measures that will make it difficult for the people to hoard money.    Q) The common man seems to be the most affected as there is inadequate change available in the market?    A) Yes, a little thought could have saved the hassles for the aam aadmi. However, the nation is supporting the move with the sole intention to have fresh start after the system is drained out of the illegal money.    Q) Will this move encourage use of plastic money and which segment will be impacted the most?    A) The use of alternate modes of payments could increase in the metros which will be beneficial for the government.    Q) How will the drive impact the elections that are scheduled early next year in Mumbai and Thane?    A) A huge segment of political leaders would possibly have been hit badly. This move will certainly impact their strategies.",city,thane,"Updated: Nov 14, 2016, 03.44 AM IST","Demonetization is fine, but strong steps needed to fight corruption",,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/Demonetization-is-fine-but-strong-steps-needed-to-fight-corruption/articleshow/55403548.cms,toi

According to sources, while room bookings have had a few cancellations, the effect on food and beverages business as well as cabs has been severe. Restaurant owners complained that business has dropped by nearly 25% as people are facing problems with paying lower denominations to avail the services. Similarly, cab operators expressed concern due to dwindling number of visitors availing their services to visit the Agency area and also for visits within the city.

86,"MUMBAI: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has assured the nation that the entire ATM network will be back on its feet in two-three weeks to swallow the sudden demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination notes, but bankers said it will take much longer, in some cases as long as six weeks, as physical configuration of the machines to accept new notes and technological changes consume time even as workers tire.    The Reserve Bank of India hasn't said how long it will take for normalcy to return. More than four lakh trays or cassettes at the ATMs need to be replaced and software needs to be rewritten at 2,02,000 ATMs in the country, bankers said.    To fix just one ATM's technology to dispense new currencies will take anywhere between 15 minutes and 2 hours depending on the kind and age of the machine. But with just 3,000 engineers, fixing the entire system is going to be a Himalayan task.    ""Each ATM would require around 15 minutes to update, plus the travel time,"" said a spokesman at NCR, which operates nearly half the country's ATMs. ""We have put our entire staff strength of around 1,000 engineers to update the ATMs. To finish the entire work, one month would be the maximum time but we are putting all efforts to get this done at the earliest.""    While the withdrawal of high denomination notes itself has come as a bolt from the blue for bankers and ATM vendors, what has caused more pain is the central bank's decision to change the size of the new currency notes. The new Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes to be circulated are smaller than the Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes being withdrawn. This means the cassettes that hold the currency notes inside the ATM machines need to be replaced.    There is no uniformity of machines. Some ATM machines not only dispense cash but also take cash. In such cases, the time taken could be as long as two hours, industry insiders said.    ""We have pressed the entire team of 1,000 engineers into service round the clock to be able to reach maximum number of ATMs at the minimum amount of time,"" said a spokesperson with AGS Transact Technologies, which runs and manages 60,000 ATMs in the country.",business,,"Nov 14, 2016, 09.56 AM IST",Demonetisation: It may take six weeks for ATMs to dispense new notes smoothly,,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-It-may-take-six-weeks-for-ATMs-to-dispense-new-notes-smoothly/articleshow/55410023.cms,toi
87,"The demonetisation of the 500 and 1,000 notes by Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems to have hit not only the common man the hardest, but also the states governments across the country.    Telangana and West Bengal chief ministers have admitted that the demonetization move has come as a bolt from the blue for the state finances and it would be difficult for the state governments to tide over the crisis without imposing budgetary cuts on the expenditure in the last four months of the current financial year that ends on March 31, 2017.    Most economists and commentators have analysed the pros and cons of the demonetization effected in the country after a long gap of 38 years. But the factors that compelled the NDA-II regime at the Centre to go in for this drastic step in the name of curbing black money and terror financing are totally different. Faced with mounting revenue and fiscal deficits, the Union government has been merrily using the RBI for increasing the money supply to increase its borrowings. This has not only triggered inflationary pressures in the economy but also contributed to the monstrous growth of the so-called black money hoarding of high denomination currency notes. Since the beginning of the financial year 2014-15, the Union governments and the states have been facing unprecedented financial crisis, which led to actual fall in central devolutions and grants to the states despite the higher quantum of central tax transfers recommended by the 14th Finance Commission. The Union government not only phased out some central schemes but also reduced the quantum of some other central schemes and changed the pattern of funding of some more central schemes. The end-result has been that the states particularly newly-formed Telangana and the residuary Andhra Pradesh, which are suffering from the pangs of separation have been embroiled in a severe financial crisis.    Official data from the Union finance ministry and the RBI provides incontrovertible facts about the ""State of the Union government's fi nancial health."" The borrowings and other liabilities of the Union government soared by as much as 14.91lakh crores (14,91,158 crores to be exact) since April 2014. The fiscal deficit of the Union government was a whopping 5,10,817 crores in 2014-15, 5,32,351 crores in 2015-16 and 4,47,990 crores during April-September 2016 (first half of 2016-17 financial year).    The RBI data shows that the money supply in the country increased by 5,49,170 crores during April 2014October 2016. Much of the currency was released into the country by way of 500 and 1,000 currency notes. Out of the currency notes worth 12.48 lakh crores at the end of March 2014, the 500 and 1,000 denomination notes accounted for 10.50 lakh crores. By end of October 2016, the notes of these two high denominations accounted for 15.77 lakh crores. The notes of 10, 20, 50 and 100 denominations accounted for a value of 2.2 lakh crores. The 500 and 1,000 denomination notes became the most popular currency and became the common stock for hoarding. The NDA-II government, which was responsible for releasing almost 5.07 lakh crores worth currency in 500 and 1,000 denominations since it came to power, has apparently embarked on unearthing the ""black money"" that it allowed the rich and the mighty to accumulate and hoard in these two higher denominations.    So, it has launched the ""surgical strikes"" on hoarders of black money after announcing the voluntary disclosure schemes twice since coming to power. These voluntary schemes failed to evoke the expected impact and the coffers of the Union government could not be filled with any worthwhile quantum of the declared black money. The total value of the money in circulation in the country right now is 18 lakh crores and the high denomination notes of 500 and 1,000 which were demonetized are worth 15.75 lakh crores. If the general public, which is in possession of this large amount of high value demonetized notes, is unable to return the entire hoard in their possession for fear of penalties and prosecution, the government hopes to get richer through indirect ""unearthing"" of the black money .    That is to say, if the government gets back only 13 lakh crores of demonetized notes by March 31,2017, the value of the remaining currency notes not deposited with the banks would be 2.75 lakh crores. The RBI would get the nod to circulate the new currency notes of this value as well.",city,hyderabad,"Nov 14, 2016, 11.01 AM IST","Soaring fiscal deficit prompts Union government to demonetise Rs 500 & 1,000 notes",,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/Soaring-fiscal-deficit-prompts-Union-government-to-demonetise-Rs-500-1000-notes/articleshow/55410765.cms,toi
88,"BHUBANESWAR: The demonetization move has come to haunt the labour contractors in Balangir district from where lakhs of people migrate to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh to work in brick kilns.    The hiring agents usually pay the labourers in advance so that they go with them to the brick kilns. The migration starts from the fag end of October and continues till December. The labourers return from the kilns in June.    According to sources, the brick kiln owners send cash to the local labour contractors, who are mostly concentrated in the Kantabanji and Belpada areas of the district. The contractors pay advance using currencies of higher denomination in order to avoid being caught by the police. The district has many unlicensed labour agents. But the phasing out process of the higher currency notes since November 9 has hit these agents hard.    Umi Daniel, who does research on migration, said: ""Labourers who have taken the advance amount will now face problems in making ends meet as they have the old currency notes. This spart, with the final payments being delayed the migration process may take a hit. The contractors, who receive money from Andhra-based brick kiln owners through banks, will find it difficult to withdraw new currency notes in bulk"".    Around 1.5 lakh people migrate from the district every year to work in the kilns. Daniel said the labourer s families (the abled ones) normally migrate as they can lend labour leaving behind the elderly at homes. They give some money to the elderly to meet their needs until they return in June. I think the elderly, who are left alone in homes will not be able to purchase anything. This will lead to more debt and exploitation by the local money lenders, he added.    Another problem that may also haunt the labour contractor is to exchange the bulk of money they kept for disbursing among the labourers. If they go to banks with the bulk money they are likely to be seen with suspicion as most of the money are unaccounted and never come into the banking system, said another observer.",city,bhubaneswar,"Updated: Nov 14, 2016, 11.07 AM IST",Demonetisation move puts brakes on labour migration,,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/Demonetisation-move-puts-brakes-on-labour-migration/articleshow/55410818.cms,toi
89,"Patna: Former Union minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) general secretary Tariq Anwar on Monday called the Centres decision to demonetise Rs1,000 and Rs500 notes as immature and said it had been done without making any alternative arrangement to meet the monetary crisis being faced by the common man in the country.  There is no doubt that solid step was needed to combat the problem of black money, but it is also a fact that any major step has to be taken with considerable advance thinking. This, however, was not done, as a result of which common man has been facing immense hardship that none had anticipated, Anwar said. The partys state spokesman Anil Kishore Jha accompanied him.  Apparently, no application of mind was made on making alternative arrangements, nor was there any blueprint. The step has proved to be immature and taken in haste, he added.  To say that the demonetisation of Rs1,000 and Rs500 notes would finally end the circulation of black money in the country is just a chunawi jumla (election rhetoric), Anwar said. He added that Morarji Desai as PM had also demonetised Rs1000, Rs5,000 and Rs10,000 notes, which impacted the rich and powerful, but the impact of the present demonetisation has been felt mostly by common man.  Anwar also said PM Narendra Modi has demonetised the Rs1000 and Rs500 notes for political advantage with eye on the assembly elections to be held next year in five states, including Uttar Pradesh. Everything that Modi does is to gain political advantage during forthcoming assembly elections, whether it is surgical strike after Uri terror attack or any other thing. Even the demonetisation step was called surgical strike against black money, Anwar said.  He said the NCP had not yet decided to join the delegation led by West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to call on President Pranab Mukherjee, nor had NCP been extended an invitation for it. For our sake, the NCP had initially welcomed the demonetisation step to fight against black money, but the banking system has been paralysed and common man is faced with enormous difficulties, Anwar added.  He said plastic money is used only by five per cent of people, while bank branches have not yet covered majority of the rural population.  Anwar said the demonetisation decision would not help combat the parallel system of black money, as most of them who own it have kept it stashed in foreign banks and only a small percentage of the total black money was in circulation in the country.",city,patna,"Updated: Nov 14, 2016, 11.12 PM IST",Demonetisation a step in haste: Tariq,,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/Demonetisation-a-step-in-haste-Tariq/articleshow/55422181.cms,toi

100,"Though 'Force 2' happens to be their maiden venture together, director Abhinay Deo and filmmaker Vipul Amrutlal Shah got along like a house on fire. No creative combat for these men, who worked seamlessly to bring alive their vision for the much-anticipated John Abraham-Sonakshi Sinha-starrer. Here are excerpts from an interview with Vipul and Abhinay before the release of the high-octane, action-packed sequel to 'Force', which opens in cinemas this Friday.  The car-lifting sequence has become the talking point of your film...Vipul:  Ever since John lifted the bike in 'Force', the sequence has become synonymous with the franchise. Everyone expects him to do something spectacular and big. I remember people thought the bike-lifting sequence was a cheat shot. So, John lifted the bike at an event to prove it and it became a talking point. We had to push the envelope in our quest to take the legacy ahead. We made him lift a car this time. We knew it would work, but the film is not just about lifting heavy weights. It has a bigger concept ' it's about spies and what happens to them and their families when the country disowns them.  Abhinay:  It's a big moment in the trailer, but the film is bigger and more intense than a particular scene. Having said that, the sequence defines an important aspect of the protagonist ' that he is not only righteous, but also physically solid.  Vipul, what made you cast Sonakshi, considering there is no apparent love track between her and John in the film?VS:  Abhinay didn't want to explore a typical love story. It's high time we started taking the relationship between a boy and a girl beyond the romantic angle. It is a modern and interesting take. We could have easily made it a two-hero film as there is no apparent love story, but girls are at par with boys in every aspect, so we wrote a female character. It was an unanimous decision to cast Sonakshi, because she has the personality to pull off the role of a RAW agent convincingly. Besides, everybody knows that she can do action really well.  Given the ongoing tension between India and Pakistan, do you think the relevance of the subject will attract moviegoers?VS:  It's a bad way to make a film with the idea of capitalising on the political situation of a country. Had that been the case, we would have added a few sequences bashing the other country. Some subjects are too real to be judged through their commercial viability. And any situation which deals with the Army or spies shouldn't be seen through the prism of commercial success/failure. If 'Force 2' can improve the situation for even a handful of spies and their families, it will be a bigger reward than its box-office collection. The subject should reach a wider audience, as this country needs to wake up to the reality of spies and their families being ignored.  But do you think demonetisation might hamper its box-office collection?VS:  A big decision like demonetisation might affect a film, but it would be a small sacrifice on our part in the larger interest of the country ' which is to clean up black money and corruption. I have faith that we have made a good film and even if we lose out on the first day, we will be back in business eventually. We are proud of the film and demonetisation won't affect its business.  Abhinay, while working with Vipul as a producer, was there any creative interference as he is also a director?AD:  Such thoughts do crop up, but Vipul has trusted my creative vision and I trusted him with the production aspect. That's the bond we have developed over time. At times, we have worn each other's hat as well. Sometimes, the budget and the vision don't come together, which was the case with this film ' the vision was bigger than the budget. If my producer came half way and did not worry about the money, on my part, I too sacrificed my fee. It's important to share the same vision, and ours was to make a mind-blowing film. There was no scope for discord.  VS:  'Force 2' belongs to Abhinay as much as it belongs to me. No one has charged a single penny in these 18 months. Abhinay has stood by me at all times.  Abhinay, Nishikant Kamat, who directed 'Force', said he is done and dusted with the film. What pushed you to take it on?AD:  That's his opinion and I can only speak for myself. Nishikant is a friend and he did a swell job in the first film. Sometimes, you need a fresh perspective to take a film to the next level and that's exactly what I have tried to do. I have taken it from where he left and steered it into a different direction. We never get tired of a genre and there is no limiting it. A subject can be explored in multiple ways.  John is known for his tough physique and action skills. Do you think his action-hero image overshadows his acting talent?AD:  Every person has his strengths and weaknesses. As a director, I needed to play up John's strengths. We extracted the best out of each other during the course of the film. Each actor has a distinct way of emoting. Our films tend to overdramatise everything, but that is not my style. OTT (over the top) as a concept doesn't exist for me. It might be in a situation, but never in the performance. John is subtle and sticks close to reality. He suits my wavelength as I like realistic filmmaking.  Abhinay, do you aspire to enter the `300-crore club like other directors? After all, even superstars chase them...AD:  I want to be a director who is sought after by actors for the right reason, which is good cinema. It shouldn't be based on the business my last film did. If that's the case, I would question their judgement. I would like my films to make `300 crore, but these clubs don't make sense to me. I define a film's success with people gaining something from the storytelling. That's more gratifying to me, even if it's pure and simple entertainment. What mark it crosses isn't my lookout. If it makes money in the process, I would be happy for the producer and myself. I wouldn't stop myself from making a `10-crore film just because another film of mine did a `300-crore business. The business doesn't govern my talent of storytelling.  Vipul, how was it to co-produce the film with John, who is also the face of the film? Did that give him an advantage?VS:  I want my actors to work on a film with a sense of ownership. I am happy that John and I are working as co-producers because it makes the experience personal for him as well. I haven't looked at the financial aspect yet. Maybe I would do that when the numbers start rolling in. When we make films, we build relationships. You can choose to be a producer who deals with situations either clinically or with empathy. If you can maintain a good relationship with the team, success and fame will follow. But if you burn bridges with people, you will be alone on the day of the premiere.  Abhinay, 'Delhi Belly' is a cult film and one expected a sequel. Why didn't you cash in on its success?AD:  It's a film waiting to be made into a second part and I would love to do it. But I am neither driven by money and fame nor is filmmaking time bound. I take time to discover a big idea. Akshat Verma (the writer of the film) took nine years to write the first script. We have a nine-year plan, so we have another four more years to go for the sequel (laughs).  Vipul, the failure of 'Action Replayy' (2010) must have been a major setback. Do you plan to get back to direction?VS:  That was my first genuine failure as a director and it taught me a great deal. I decided to take a long break from direction to reinvent myself. I am returning to direction soon, and I know it will feel like my first film, as I will be approaching it with a fresh perspective. I am in discussion with Akshay (Kumar) for a project. I am writing the script, and will narrate to him soon.

101,"NEW DELHI: The political battle over scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes is set to move to Parliament with the opposition saying the measure had caused unwarranted hardship and PM Narendra Modi leading the government's response, saying he had  acted against the dishonest on behalf of the poor+  .    While Modi set the tone for the ruling party with an  aggressive speech in UP+  where he said he had his finger on the pulse of the poor and was acting on his mandate, the opposition called the demonetisation measure a ""scripted scam"" and claimed the ruling BJP had been tipped off and had secured its funds.    The  decision to replace Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes+  is expected to be debated in both Houses of Parliament this week with all opposition parties raising the issue of difficulties caused to ordinary citizens with long queues outside banks and ATMs during an all-party meeting convened by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan.    The opposition said the sudden delegitimising of currency notes had led to a crisis for the poor who depended on daily wages and trade had been severely impacted. Some leaders said the move was inadequate as a lot of black money was stashed abroad and demanded better redressal of public distress. The government said it was willing to discuss measures.    The arguments provided a precursor for debates that are likely to take place in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha where the ruling side is keen on capitalising on what it sees as a bold and popular move while opposition leaders look to reduce the sheen by slamming demonetisation as a poorly thought out diversionary tactic to deflect attention from the government's failures.    Even parties such as BJD and AIADMK, which did not join the opposition deliberations hosted separately by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, said there was a need to address the difficulties faced by citizens while SP and Congress were sharp in criticising the move as poorly planned and executed. NDA allies Shiv Sena and Akali Dal backed the government at the meeting.    Congress did not raise the scam allegation at the Speaker's meeting, choosing to do so after hosting SP, TMC, JD(U), Left, RJD and YSR Congress leaders on Monday. Azad alleged that information about demonetisation had been leaked, a charge rebutted by NDA which said parties opposing the move were aligned with black marketers and hoarders.    Samajwadi Party, DMK, NCP and BSP did not take part in the deliberations at Azad's office even though SP and BSP have come out strongly against demonetisation. The opposition leaders who met on Monday are to meet again to frame a common strategy for the  winter session of Parliament+  that gets underway on Wednesday.    The political lines seem clearly drawn as BJP has lashed out at vocal opponents like Trinamool Congress, SP, BSP, Congress and Left, saying the parties needed to explain their opposition to the move to target black money. The opposition made its intent clear enough by accusing the government of acting out of political motives and delivering an unnecessary shock to the financial system.    Though the opposition is united about cornering the government over implementation of the move, its economic impact and allegations that information was leaked to the ruling party, there are differences over alignments. JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar and the CPM are decidedly cold to the idea of joining Mamata Banerjee's bid to form a loose front against the government over demonetisation.    If Parliament does discuss the issue this week itself as it is likely to, the steam would be vented and the government can look forward to transacting its business like bills relating to the rollout of GST.",entertainment,,"Updated: Jan 29, 2017, 06.09 AM IST","Vipul Amrutlal Shah: Demonetisation might affect my film, but it would be a small sacrifice for the country",,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/bollywood-news/Vipul-Amrutlal-Shah-Demonetisation-might-affect-my-film-but-it-would-be-a-small-sacrifice-for-the-country/articleshow/55415687.cms,toi

""Leaders from your (Nehru's) party and your family are levelling allegations against me, but despite that, on your birthday, I am starting projects to fulfil your dreams for the region,"" Modi said.    Conceding that the people were facing difficulties due to demonetisation, Modi said the move was ""necessary"" in national interest.    ""My decision is a little harsh. When I was young, poor people used to ask for 'kadak chai' (strong tea), but it spoils the mood of the rich who can't bear its taste,"" Modi said.    Laying into the Congress, which has accused him of causing harassment to the people with the demonetization drive, Modi said, ""It was the Congress that imposed Emergency and turned the nation into a jail for 19 months for saving the 'gaddi' (chair) of Indira Gandhi. But I need people's support for only 50 days to nail the corrupt.""    Modi accused the Congress of misleading the country since 1962, particularly on poverty in Purvanchal (east UP), by citing a discussion from the third Lok Sabha (1962) when the then Ghazipur MP, Vishwanath Singh Gahmari, painted a grim picture of deprivation in Purvanchal before Nehru in Parliament.    ""The entire House was in tears when Gahmari told the story of how people collected grains of wheat from cow dung for food after washing. Nehru had then formed a committee headed by H N Patel which gave a report on poverty in the region, but was shelved,"" he said.    ""Uttar Pradesh has given several prime ministers to the country, and I am the ninth. The Patel committee report remained on the back-burner for many years. I have intentionally chosen November 14 to bring out the dead file,"" said Modi, adding that the dream of a bridge over the Ganga will bear fruit and bring development to the region.    Modi also recalled the brave soldiers of Ghazipur like Veer Abdul Hamid, a Param Vir Chakra awardee and inaugurated railway projects in Ghazipur.    ""Congressmen today want to know under which law I banned Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. You (Congress) had also banned 'chavanni' (25 paise coin). You did as per your capabilities; I did as per mine,"" he said.    Modi then asked the audience, ""Should I be afraid of such people? Should I leave the fight midway?"" The reply came: a loud 'no'.    The PM said  crores in counterfeit currency+  were being pumped into the country to fund terrorists and Maoists by ""the enemy from across the border"".

103,"Trichy: Since the ordeal of people in rural areas, particularly those from the farming community, is continuing with the ongoing process of demonetisation, farmers have appealed to the RBI to utilise the service of primary agriculture cooperative credit societies (PACCS), which are well equipped with the required infrastructure for rupee exchange.    Meanwhile, officials from the cooperative department opined that, like civic bodies, which are collecting various taxes from the public, PACCSs may also be allowed to accept loan dues from the farming community. Such a move would be of immense help for the rural folks, an official said. ""Around 3,878 PACCSs are functioning across Tamil Nadu and all of them are housed in common service centres, from where the general public get various certificates. The centres are equipped with computers with network facility, printers and scanners,"" he told TOI.    Secretary of the Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai R Vimalnathan said that agriculture labourers in rural areas are finding it difficult to get sufficient 100 currency notes. ""Farmers are struggling to purchase fertilizers for paddy crops. They also find it difficult to disburse wages to agriculture labourers due to the cash crunch. Many farmers have been forced to postpone farming operations due to the situation. A similar condition prevails at branch and sub-post offices in rural areas,"" he said.    ""Societies functioning across the country can be utilised to handle the situation. Such a move would help to bring down the number of people converging at banks and ATMs in urban areas. Since the societies have the required facility with available staff, the RBI may allow the cooperative department to execute the process,"" he added.    N Pannerselvam of Orathanadu in Thanjavur district said the cash crunch has stalled the transplantation of nursery in his land, as laborers demand the exact change for wages.

""Either way we are facing the brunt of the situation. People are now presenting 2,000 currency notes while paying their bills of much smaller amounts like 200 or 300 and expect change in notes of 100. How long can we go on like this,"" president of South Goa Hotels and Restaurant Owners' Association C P Jaggi told TOI, adding that the situation will turn to normal only after new currency notes of 500 denomination come into circulation.  What has worsened the situation, Jaggi feels, is the recent rumour that was doing the rounds that the new currency notes of 2,000 denomination would have a chip embedded in it so that they can detected by a satellite. ""People therefore are wary of keeping these notes with them in the fear of getting detected for hoarding money, and want to spend it as early as possible,"" Jaggi said.

Dr Sameer Paltewar, MD of Meditrina, said, ""What we have been doing till now is illegal. We were accepting cash to help patients. Today, we also wrote to the I-T commissioner for clarification. We did not deny treatment to anyone for money.""    Patients at Getwell Hospital in Dhantoli also complained that the hospital and pharmacy were not accepting demonetized notes. ""It is really a big harassment,"" said Neetu Poptani from Katni, Madhya Pradesh. ""We cannot do laboratory tests too, which decide further course of treatment,"" said Anirudha Mishra.

107,"KOLHAPUR: City-based real estate developers have claimed that demonetisation of old high-value will have very little impact on the sector and help customers find homes at cheaper rates.    The common understanding is that the real estate and bullion trade involves high amount of black money transactions. As a result, the sector will be badly affected and the property rates will reduce immediately.    However, developers claimed that the use of black money in the sector is high in larger cities, where the decision will have a huge impact.    Mahesh Yadav, president of Credai (Kolhapur), said, ""The decision has led to an increase in the currency stock of banks. Banks are now supposed to reduce interest rates, which will help customers buy flats or houses easily. At present, the temporary cash crunch has not stopped customers from buying homes.""    Ever since the decision was announced a few days ago, experts have been claiming claimed that land rates will come down suddenly, and the rates of flats and houses thereafter.    Yadav said since the ready reckoner rates are more or less equal to the market rates for Kolhapur, there will not be a major change in land prices. Moreover, it is speculated that eviction of black money from the sector will help bring the construction cost down by at least 20%. At present, the sector is facing a slowdown and the developers are unable to sell flats because of capping of prices on the higher side.    Ajit Narke, a city-based developer, said, ""People have a golden opportunity to invest in real estate in the near future.

The unity show, however, weakened a little over Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee's proposal to take up the matter with President Pranab Mukherjee. Hours before the gathering at Azad's chamber, Sitaram Yechury turned down the Trinamool chief's offer to accompany her to the President. The CPM general secretary held that his party had already served notices in Parliament to suspend all business to discuss this issue. It would be meaningful to call on the President after demanding the government's explanation in Parliament in the winter session, he argued.    But Mamata is unfazed. She will be going to the central hall of Parliament on Tuesday afternoon to speak to the Opposition leaders, even if the Left stays away from the delegation to the President on November 16. As of now, National Conference and Aam Admi Party have responded to Mamata Banerjee's call.    Whatever the difference, Opposition parties like Congress, Trinamool, CPI, CPM, Nitish Kumar's JD(U), Lalu Prasad's RJD, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, YSR Congress, Mulayam Singh's SP and Mayawati's BSP are all on the same page over voicing the difficulties that the Modi government has thrust upon the common man. Leaders who later met at Congress Lok Sabha leader Mallikarjun Kharge's chamber said that they would again meet on Tuesday afternoon to take stock of the situation. Trinamool leader in the Lok Sabha Sudip Bandyopadhyay is already in touch with the Opposition leaders. ""Some other leaders from Samajwadi Party, DMK and NCP are expected to attend the meet tomorrow,"" said Bandyopadhyay. The challenge of the Opposition is to gain the maximum numbers in the Lok Sabha when they are already in a better position in the Rajya Sabha.    Fearing that the sudden liquidity crunch would push prices of essential commodities, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee waived the agricultural tax on truckers for the next three days. Some of the state public utilities such as the Kolkata Municipal Corporation has announced that it will accept old 500- and 1000-rupee notes for paying property tax.    CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury also wanted the Modi government to allow people use old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes for some more time. ""Yesterday, the PM asked people to give him 50 days. But people are dying as they can't pay for treatment. Allow people to use the old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes at least in public utilities and for white transactions. The Kerala government has permitted it till December 21.

""The PM said people of the country have supported the decision overwhelmingly but opposition parties want to sabotage it, which should be strongly countered,"" parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar said after a meeting of the BJP parliamentary board followed by one of NDA constituents to discuss strategy for the winter session.

During the NDA meeting, finance minister Arun Jaitley briefed functionaries about measures being taken to ease the cash crunch.    On the winter session and the possibility of disruptions, Naidu said the Parliament would show who were on the side of black money and who were with the government's crusade against corruption.""Even  rumours like salt crisis+  were discussed as vested interests are trying to derail the process,"" he added.

The release of one Kannada movie was put off last week.    With single screens, the mainstay of Sandalwood's box office collections, reporting sparse audiences after the November 8 demonetization, the Kannada film industry is all nerves. While producers of John Jani Janardhan, which was to hit the screens on November 11, backtracked, the makers of Nataraja Service and Badmaash, slated to release this week, have decided to go ahead.    Nataraja Service distributor M Muniraju from Sri Veeranjaneya Productions said they can't keep the release on hold as the after-effects of demonetization are likely to linger till December-end. Confirming the Sharan and Mayuri Kanti-starrer will be released in 200 theatres across the state, he said they are hopeful their product is strong enough to shrug off the negativity. The movie is directed by Pavan Wadeyar.    Stating that audiences are staying away from theatres as they don't want to exhaust their limited stock of notes of smaller denomination, industry sources said film makers are planning to request the audience to turn up in groups so high denomination notes can be tendered.

The money changers could not trade currencies due to deficiency of funds after the Union government set a withdrawal limit of 10,000 per day from banks for current account holders.    The clients of currency exchange firms mostly include local people periodically receiving money electronically from their relatives living abroad and foreign tourists visiting the former French enclave. The money changers said local people were reluctant to receive cheques as they did not want to be caught in the restrictions imposed on withdrawal of cash from banks. Foreign tourists, who do not have any bank account in India, cannot accept cheques too. As they do not have much options to exchange foreign currencies with Indian rupees, their stay in the coastal town is becoming a nightmare.    There are roughly 20 foreign exchanges in Puducherry and all of them reported that business had come down drastically to less than 20% in the last six days.

121,"NEW DELHI: Demonetisation of higher denomination currency notes by the government seems to have dealt a  body blow to funding of terror+  in Jammu & Kashmir as well as Left-wing extremist violence across several states.    While hawala cash transfers to terrorists and separatist elements based in Kashmir, which were mostly in  denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000+  , have come to an abrupt halt, Maoist groups, particularly in states like Bihar and Jharkhand, are at pains to ""convert"" the extortion money that has been stocked as piles of cash into 'legal tender', according to sources.    An intelligence officer tracking terror funding in Jammu & Kashmir said hawala channels had run dry after the the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. With no unaccounted cash to fund violence and protests in the valley, the lead trouble-makers have been forced to lie low. For, they no longer have the money to pay the local youths to pelt stones and stage violent protests.    A source said logistics for any terror operation or mob protests require money, which is almost entirely paid through hawala. ""It is therefore interesting to note that no major terror attack has been reported in the valley since November 8,"" he said.    ""Though this could be partially on account of normalcy having returned to the valley prior to demonetisation, it also indicates that terrorists are now finding it difficult to fund their activities,"" said a senior officer of the security establishment.    The officer said the lull in terror operations could be utilised by the security forces to step up counter-operations against terrorists holed up in the valley. ""First turn off the resources of terror outfits and then neutralise terrorists before they can find a way of replenishing their coffers,"" said the officer.    According to intelligence inputs, the bigger casualty in terms of sheer volume of funds, however, is Left-wing extremism. Intercepts of recent conversations among CPI(Maoist) leaders based in Bihar and Jharkhand show them discussing the fear of losing their piles of cash collected through extortion and 'levy'. Government agencies have, meanwhile, stepped up surveillance to track money flow in naxal-infested areas. There are intelligence inputs that Maoists may target banks and cash vans to make good their losses, leading the security forces to step up vigil.    It is learnt that senior Maoist leaders have contacted their trusted relatives and friends to explore possibilities of exchanging their stashed cash. Maoist undertrials have expressed helplessness in saving their cash stacked with confidants.    As per estimates of intelligence agencies and other experts, the annual money collection by Maoists may be over Rs 1,500 crore. The extortion from tendu patta contractors itself amounts to Rs 200 crore per state. Besides, 'levy' is collected from road contractors and big industrial houses carrying out mining activities in states like Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.    As many as 124 incidents of extortion/levy by Maoists have been reported so far this year, resulting in death of 17 civilians. Most of these incidents were concentrated in Bihar and Jharkhand. In a recent crackdown on Maoists on November 3, three persons were arrested and around 86.5 lakh recovered.    Maoist fronts in metros like Kolkata and Delhi have come forward to publicly oppose demonetisation, with some holding protests demanding a rollback and members of a CPI(Maoist) student wing in Delhi launching propaganda against demonetisation through social media posts.

122,"NEW DELHI: The threat of a washout looms over the winter session of Parliament with Congress likely to demand that a discussion on  scrapping Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes+  be accompanied with a government explanation and an inquiry into alleged ""leak of information"" about demonetisation.    Congress apprehends that the raging row will be defused if the government accepts the adjournment notice for debate given by the Congress-led opposition and this will pave the way for business as usual. But a demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe, unlikely to be acceptable to the government, will stoke the confrontation.    On the eve of the session, the entire non-NDA camp, including SP, BSP, NCP and DMK, attended a strategy session called by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad.    Besides, Trinamool Congress of Mamata Banerjee has already declared its aggressive intent. All these parties have been seen as soft on the Centre with some distancing themselves from Congress's aggression on issues like GST in the past.    Their combined numbers and lung power give the opposition the muscle to dictate running of the two Houses.    While Congress on its own has an upper hand in Rajya Sabha, the new-found opposition unity also bodes ill for Lok Sabha which has bucked Congress's past blockade because of NDA's brute majority as well as the lead opposition player's isolation.    Ahead of the session, the prospects of the month-long session falling victim to a standoff is seen as a serious possibility though it will have to be seen if the demonetisation glue holds. Sources said the opposition camp will finalise the strategy in a meeting on Wednesday morning.    The opposition will target  demonetisation as a ""scam""+  by alleging that the policy change was leaked in advance to benefit BJP-friendly entities, even questioning the ""intent"" behind the decision.    Tainting the controversial policy, besides focussing on the ""inconvenience and harassment"" faced by common people, is seen as the best way to neutralise the moral high ground that the Centre is seeking to occupy through the policy it has dubbed as a ""surgical strike on black money"".

Political parties and their leaders, who are making a hue and cry in the name of poor people after demonetization of currency notes of Rs500 and Rs1,000 denominations, are trying to befool them as they have been worst hit by this action of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""    The BJP president said, ""There were scams to the tune of Rs 12 lakh crore during the 10-year rule of Congress-led UPA government and that many Congress leaders protected black marketeers.

124,"JAIPUR: More than 150 eminent citizens, including economist Prabhat Patnaik, Aruna Roy and Nikhil Dey of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sanghatan and lawyer-activist Prashant Bhushan appealed to the government to roll back the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. They have put forth nine points to explain why the move is not likely to achieve the desired ends:    If high-value notes are used to ""hoard black money"", then ""issuing even higher value Rs 2,000 note is completely inexplicable,"" they say. ""Black money is generated through evasion of taxes on income from lawful activities and money generated from illegal activities."" Those who have amassed black money can convert it to bullion, real estate and foreign currency. The former RBI Governor and the current chief economist of the World Bank have spoken against demonetization. Eighty-six percent of currency in circulation and 97% of all transactions by volume are done in cash. ""Summary demonetization has created chaos"", the letter notes.    Only 30% of the Indian population has access to the banking system, as per data compiled by the finance ministry. The distribution of banks is extremely skewed, with a third of all bank branches in the Tier 1 and 2 cities - ""people in rural India who often also suffer from inadequate information have become the worst victims of demonetization."" All currency only has value because of the inherent trust in the banking system, and the summary demonetization has shaken this trust, the letter writers say, seeking clarifications on some points.    ""Rs 1.14 lakh crore of bad debts have been waived by government banks in the last three years. At the same time, loans worth lakhs of crores of rupees are still outstanding. Why has the government not made public the names of the beneficiaries of the waiver and the names of big defaulters, both individuals and corporations?"" The letter writers ask why the government announced that cash deposits of over Rs 2.5 lakh would be scrutinized and tax return with 200% penalty imposed for any tax evasion - this appears to be intended to dissuade people from depositing money so that the government can claim success of demonetization and forewarn people to split their deposits among different accounts and different depositers, the letter says.    The letter writers note that conversions can be done only after filling a form and attaching ID proof - major harassment for the poor and illiterate, many of whom have no identity card. The writers note that the cost of replacing the currency is estimated at Rs 20,000 crore. Far greater losses will be incurred in markets predominantly run on cash. Before effecting such a change, adequate new notes should have been printed; arrangements should have been made for its proper distribution, ATMs should have been recalibrated.

In a memorandum submitted to the Puducherry chief secretary, PPCC unanimously expressed its anguish to the 'faulty and hasty decision' to demonetise the denominations of 500 and 1,000 with effect of midnight of November 8.    ""It has crated great panic and anarchic situation in the society at large and the victim of such policy is the Aam Aadmi of the great nation,"" the members said in the memorandum while arguing that the decision without proper planning to meet the exigencies exposed the weakness of central government to solve common man's sufferings since November 8.    Terming the demonetisation as a 'cover up' political stunt to conceal its inability to bring forth the black money stashed in foreign banks and distribute them among the Indian citizens as promised by Modi ahead of polls, they said the decision had caused immense hardship to the common man in purchasing daily rations, groceries, vegetables and other essential commodities. They said the move adversely affected the trade and commerce and small vendours and restaurants. ""It had resulted in huge loss to an extent of more than 5 crore per day in Puducherry,"" they said.

127,"HYDERABAD: A whopping Rs 68,000 crore cash has gone out of circulation in Telangana, courtesy demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes announced by PM Narendra Modi on November 8.    The state normally enjoys a total cash circulation of Rs 80,000 crore a month from which it usually earns Rs 4,200 crore as tax revenue. However, according to a government estimate, 85 per cent of the Rs 80,000 crore cash had gone out of circulation from November 9 making the state government poorer overnight.    The withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has pushed the state's finances into doldrums as entire economic activity came to a grinding halt. The finance department on Tuesday submitted a comprehensive report to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in which it narrated the colossal damage the demonetisation has caused to Telangana's economy. ""Normally, the state earns Rs 4,200 crore in tax and non-tax earnings from its own revenue resources. But with the demonetisation, there has been a total shutdown of activity. Worst affected was the stamps and registrations department which reported a 70 per cent drop in revenue followed by liquor sale which was down by 50 per cent.    The commercial taxes collections came down by 25 to 30 per cent. All put together the state has lost over Rs 1,000 crore in November alone,"" said the report. The finance department sees no major change in the situation for next two months as the Reserve Bank of India already announced a 50-day schedule for complete changeover to the new currency. The department pointed that the pain caused by demonetisation will continue to haunt the state for next two to three months.    KCR directed the finance department to stop all payments and impose treasury controls so that whatever money received by the government would be used for the salary and pension bill for November. ""Clearing the salary and pension bill of `2,250 crore will be no problem as we are expecting Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,200 crore in revenue,"" said a senior official in the finance department.

The demonetisation has had an adverse impact on all the artisans participating in the fair, said Ajmal Khan, who had come all the way from Saharanpur to exhibit an array of wooden furniture. The otherwise abuzz Urban Haat that witnesses one of the biggest shopping extravaganza, Gandhi Shilp Bazaar, did not see much footfall of buyers or art lovers on day four of the ongoing fair. The participants had a hard time finding serious buyers while some even suffered losses owing to lack of notes of lower denominations.The low turnout of buyers is because of the recent demonetization move by government which has the people and the shoppers in a fix. Many said the sales had dipped to about 50%-80% as compared to last year. ""I had boarded the train for Varanasi when the news of demonetization broke out. I could not go back as all the arrangements had been made and the goods were on way. We have hardly managed to earn Rs 2,000-3,000 which is disappointing,"" Khan said.Kailash Kumar, a manufacturer of Haryanavi Zari Jutti (sandals) said that the sales had plummeted by 50%.

132,"NEW DELHI: The dean of diplomatic corps, who represents foreign envoys in India, has sought the external affairs ministrys help in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modis currency recall drive as many diplomats are running short of cash and diplomatic missions are besieged with calls from frantic tourists and delegates visiting the country.  Hans Dannenberg Castellanos, ambassador of the Dominican Republic, who holds the rotating post of the dean at present, has submitted a letter to the ministry seeking help for the diplomatic missions, people aware of the matter told ET.    Many diplomats are bearing the brunt of cash scarcity, they said, even as embassies in the capital have in principle hailed the Modi governments move aimed at weeding out black money. A senior diplomat of a European nation, for example, was seen amid the panic rush at a bank trying to arrange cash for an event.    Similarly, many delegates from about 140 nations who had arrived in Delhi to attend the climate change event COP7 were left holding old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes after they had exchanged their currencies just ahead of the recall.    These delegates turned to their respective embassies in despair, said a senior diplomat who did not wish to be identified. Embassies which receive visa fees in hard currency and not demand drafts and cheques are also facing problems, the diplomat said.    Foreign tourists said they faced a particularly trying time since several money changers had also run out of local currency. The situation, without any Indian money at all, is very difficult. We can only use credit cards and debit cards, said a tourist from a European nation, who did not wish to be identified.    While, one of Indias old allies hailed the PMs move and said that its diplomats had no complaints, China said banning notes was not the way to fight the menace of black money. Modi means well and his decision was made based on the reality in India, since most illegal business in the underground economy is cash-only, and Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes constitute over 80% of all cash circulation in India.

Nepal and Bhutan are the only two countries which allow Indian travellers to carry up to Rs 25,000 in paper currency. Beginning last year, the RBI allowed Indians to carry this amount in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as well, which has resulted in a large amount of these notes entering and being circulated through the two countries.

'But they buy vegetables, fish and meat from street markets, not from supermarkets. And they can't pay shopkeepers in anything other than cash,' Dickson says.    Eldho, production controller, agrees. 'The food expenses itself come to ` 25-35,000 daily on a set. Even if you know the caterer, you have to give ` 10,000 as a mess deposit, in cash. He can't buy vegetables with a cheque.' While shooting in cities in Kerala and other areas familiar to them, shopkeepers and caterers are willing to opt for later payments but not so when you are shooting in rural areas or outside Kerala, Eldho adds.  Art properties require cash  When you have to buy something as small as a bit of cloth from a roadside shop, nothing but cash works, says Vijay Babu, actor and producer. 'These are for one-time use and you don't spend too much on them, and mostly buy them from roadside shops. Also, for locations, we pick out a house or a shop and pay them ` 2000-2500 as daily rent. Daily expenses are a real issue.'    The shoot of a grand sequence of Dileep's Kammarasambhavam has been postponed for this reason, says Dickson. 'The set needed something on the lines of the Second World War. We are unable to manage the properties.'    The junior artistes also need to be paid between `750 and 2000 daily in cash, which is becoming difficult, Dickson adds. 'We are trying to transfer the entire money to one person's account now.'    Paying for diesel is another problem the crew faces, especially those which are travelling around.  Films in remote locations worst hit  Vineeth Sreenivasan starrer Aby is being shot in Gundlupet, a small town in Karnataka. And it's out of the question to think of withdrawing money from ATMs there, says the crew. 'There are long queues outside every ATM in the area. Finally we travelled 60 km to Mysore to visit an SBI bank, but were told that we can have only 6k in cash, as the bank was out of money,' says Anil, production controller. 'Six thousand rupees doesn't get you anywhere. Besides the daily food, we need cash for art properties. Few shops in Gudlupet accept cards. There is no way we can stop the shoot now or come back to Gundlupet at a later date,' he adds.  Small films affected most  While the bigger films are able to hold off the payments, small films don't have the luxury. 'When it is a Dulquer film with a known producer, people will be willing to money transfer to accounts or accept cheques. But not so for smaller films. You can't blame caterers either, as they don't even know if the films will get completed,' says Dickson.    While Eldho feels it is nothing short of an emergency, Vijay Babu is of the opinion that the changes will only bring about a positive transformation in the industry, eventually. 'Till Christmas, the problems will persist. Films are already getting postponed and many releases might get clubbed at a later date. But all this is for the good, when you look at the larger picture. New terms and conditions will evolve. All industries need correction. And there will definitely be a lot of positive reformation in the film industry,' he says.",city,coimbatore,"Updated: Nov 16, 2016, 01.11 PM IST",Tirupur garment industry tides over demonetisation crisis,,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/Tirupur-garment-industry-tides-over-demonetisation-crisis/articleshow/55452910.cms,toi
139,"While pre-wedding preparations can give sleepless nights to the bride and groom, their families also go through this roller-coaster ride of emotions. It's a different story now with the recent demonetization situation. From exchanging old currencies for new and long queues outside banks and ATM machines is what giving many of us sleepless nights and body aches, all thanks to standing in serpentine queues. ""Weddings are all about fun and upbeat mood. Sadly for me, it's all about standing in queues in front of the bank. That's the dominant wedding memory I will have, it seems,"" says Mahesh Satdev, a software professional who's tying the knot very soon.  Not keeping tabs; a severe issue  As if the announcement of old currency being scrapped wasn't a big blow, shortage of cash is certainly a grave issue for the common man. When it comes to marriage there are many last minute expenses which are mostly met through cash transactions. Mahesh says, ""Last minute wedding expenses are always done by cash. Not everyone accepts payments through cheque, cards or net banking. A tab must be kept on cash withdrawal from ATM machines as one can get cash through use of multiple cards. The withdrawal limit hardly meets the need and many ATM machines are out of service too.""  Dip in ceremonies and events  Catering services are vital to any wedding and it has been hit badly by demonetization. Inder Balani, a well-known city based caterer says, ""Overall there's a 25% - 30% dip in the spending patterns. For instance, if someone is opting for a package where it is ` 1500 per plate, they are now opting for ` 800 per plate packages. And the number of functions has gone down tremendously. While we accept payments though cheque and netbanking systems, we have to keep some spare cash for attending last minute needs and for paying the labourers. This is where we face the brunt of the new system. We have asked our contractors and labourers to open a bank account so that we can make their payments through cheques.""    Zakir Hussain, a city based hotelier adds, ""Although no wedding events have been cancelled yet, but the number of items on the wedding lunch/dinner menu has gone down."" Vivek Sultania, city based florist shares, ""Our clients pay us through cheques, so there are no delayed payments. But many of us deal directly with small time vendors who provide us flowers straight from the market. These vendors have no bank accounts and need cash payment. So mid-level and small-level vendors face the maximum brunt.""  Balancing it out  While making full payments in cash is not really feasible, payments are done through cheques and netbanking only. While clients can pay through cheques, the main issue is paying small time labourers, vendors and contractors. City based wedding planner Rajesh Ravani shares, ""It's a tough situation. The good point is that there are no cancellation of weddings. Secondly, people are ready to give you services and props on credit, depending upon your credibility. Also with the kind of withdrawal limits from the bank, we are able to make payments where only cash is accepted. Whenever it's feasible, we try to make do with old currency. Most of our contractors have bank accounts so there's no problems there.""  No cancellations, though  In the midst of all this chaos, it seems that couples are all ready to take 'I do' plunge. Even as India reels under the impact of demonetization, the queries are still pouring in, suggests Gayatri Hurra, marketing communications manager, with a city based hotel. ""It is true that the wedding market is feeling the pinch of demonetization situation, but there are no    cancellations of the events scheduled for the coming months. People are also enquiring about the availability of banquets; mostly payments or token payments are done through cheque or netbanking, hence this is a saving grace.""",entertainment,,"Updated: Jan 27, 2017, 04.40 PM IST",Malayalam film shoots stalled due to demonetisation,,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/Malayalam-film-shoots-stalled-due-to-demonetisation/articleshow/55455516.cms,toi
140,"Kanpur: The demonetisation, which has also effected the farming practices, may result in a hike in wheat prices in future.    Farmers are unable to purchase seeds, necessary fertilizers and other important things in absence of lower denomination currency notes, delaying the sowing of wheat crop. And the delay may bring a rise in wheat rates ultimately increasing the prices of various food items.    In north India the best time to sow wheat crop is from November 1 to 10 and if it is delayed till December 10 then both the quality and yield get affected. ""This is the perfect time to sow seeds for wheat crop to yield the best quality but as we have no money in lower denomination currency notes it would be delayed. The delay will result in bad quality and low yield,"" said farmer Dhram Singh, a resident of Gagan Kheda village, Sarsaul, Kanpur.    ""Though one can sow wheat crop till December 15 but the prime time is between November 1 and November 20. The productivity in such land where seeds will be sown late will degrade. On every one acre of land there would be a loss of five to seven quintals of the crop,' he added.    Another elderly farmer of the same village, Surendra Singh Yadav said, ""We dont have new currency notes to buy seeds and fertilizers to sow wheat crop. We are getting only old currency notes from wholesalers by selling seasonal vegetables With the limit of only Rs 4,000 to exchange at a time and now indelible ink, how will we exchange big amount which is required when ATMs too are dispensing only Rs. 2000 that too after struggling for entire day.""    Agriculture experts have also claimed that demonetization will certainly affect the agriculture cycle which is totally depended on perfect timing of sowing crops.    Dr Karam Hussian from Agronomy department of Chandra Shekhar Azad Univeristy of agriculture and technology said at present there is a decline in the purchase of seeds from the seed store of university. From a sale of three lakh rupees per day of seeds, it has come down to around one lakh. Also If wheat is sown in December month, there would be a decline of 10 to 12 quintal of crop per acres, he added.    He also advised farmers to increase the quantity of seeds for sowing and do proper irrigation if they sow seeds in December.

142,"THANE: Petrol and diesel sales recorded a rise of over 60% in the last week as motorists queued up at the fuel stations to tank up their vehicles in the wake of the frenzy triggered by the limited validity of the high value currency.    Vehicle owners faced with the shortage of change and the free passage at the toll gates appear to have ditched public transport or the auto rickshaws and instead choose to drive in their own cars or ride on the bikes.    The easy and a better option to standing in the long queue outside the banks was to exhaust the old currency at the petrol pumps, which fuelled the sales to soar higher, most locals said.    ""Prior to the PMs announcement, the average weekly sale of petrol at my outlet was around Rs 90,000. However, people suddenly rushed to tank up their vehicles resulting in sales soaring to over Rs 1.50 lakhs since last Tuesday. The overall sale of the petrol pump was more during the initial three days of the ban,"" said Tarachand Savla, manager of a petrol pump at Majiwada.    As the demand increased, the dealers ensured smooth supply so as to avoid any trouble.    In fact, the frequency of the tankers supplying petrol and diesal too increased with the heavy vehicles making two trips a day to the petrol outlets across the city.    ""Usually in a day we would get 20,000 to 25,000 liters of fuel, but in the initial three days i.e from Tuesday to Thursday the demand was so much that we had to get around 40,000 to 45,000 liters of fuel. Also during these past few days our sale has increased by around 25% and most of the transactions are done in cash and only few are using card for making payments,"" said M K Ramdas, manager of Kapurbawadi petrol pump.    The outlet owners claimed many customers just came to get change against their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. As a result, the petrol pumps are facing a problem of returning change. At few petrol pumps the customers are asked to wait for at least 15 minutes till the time the staff gets exact change to return. Some pumps were even giving cash memos and were asking motorists to come and collect the change later, but that was eventually stopped as it was creating a chaos at the petrol pumps, stated the owners.    It was also seen that the queues at fuel stations declined when the queues at banks increased.    ""The crowd reduced on the day the banks started. The number was high on the initial three days, as people wanted to get rid of the Rs 500 and 1000 notes and petrol pumps were an easier option.

146,"NEW DELHI: The government put a strong defence of its decision on demonetisation on Wednesday, claiming PM Narendra Modi has delivered on his mandate to curb corruption and that the courageous move is a befitting response to criticism that it works for big business.    Responding to the opposition's charge that common people had been hit by demonetisation, information and broadcasting minister M Venkaiah Naidu said the ordinary folk had backed the move while black money hoarders don't deserve any sympathy. ""Unfortunately some voices are being raised in favour of them (black money),"" he said.    Comparing the implementation of the demonetisation decision with labour pain, Naidu said, ""A mother undergoes huge labour pain while giving birth to a child. But when she hears the child of the newborn, she feels the greatest joy."" The comparison suggested the returns for the move will more than justify the current discomfort of the people.    Earlier batting for the government, minister of state for power Piyush Goyal said the country is welcoming this decision. ""When the Prime Minister was elected, he was elected on a mandate to curb corruption and black money. For the first time, the honest have been honoured and the dishonest have been troubled. There is no obstruction on the money earned by honest means. This is no curb on anyone's honest income. This move attacks those who have illicit cash,"" Goyal told the upper House.    The government speakers stood their ground against the opposition that alleged the Centre had put the common people to great hardships by arguing that despite the discomfort the citizens were supporting Modi's decision. They made the political point that Modi had gone much beyond his predecessors in launching an all-out war against corruption that seriously hurt those harbouring illegal wealth.    Naidu said the government is concerned about the pain that people are going through and the Prime Minister is holding daily review meetings to improve matters.    He termed ""absurd"" allegations that information about the move was leaked before November 8. ""In this country, elections keep happening. So, the argument that the decision was taken with elections in mind is not valid,"" Naidu said.    The minister asked Congress to make it clear whether the party was with black money hoarders, or for cleaning up the system. Claiming the move as another aspect of Swachh Bharat (clean money), he said, ""If your money is valid, it won't become invalid.""

148,"VISAKHAPATNAM: One week after the demonetisation drive was launched, fish prices have nosedived by nearly 60 per cent at various landing centres of the district.    According to sources, more than 90 per cent of the motorised boats in the fishing harbour have been anchored due to the low rates prevailing for fish and also due to the difficulties being faced in procuring fuel for the boats. At the same time, sources said fisherwomen who are mainly involved in door-to-door sale of fish in the district are bearing the brunt of demonetisation as they are unable to get their hands on lower denominations for a smooth trade. More than 13,000 fisherfolk have been affected due to the lack of lower denominations in the district, the sources said.    While king fish normally sold at around Rs 600 per kilo, it now sells for Rs 200-250 per kilo, while the price of seer fish has dropped from Rs 350 per kilo to Rs 150-200. Also, rates of croaker fish, ribbon fish and goat fish have dropped from the normal rates of Rs 60-70 per kilo to Rs 35-40.    Speaking to TOI, District Fishermen's Youth Welfare Association executive secretary Arjilli Dasu said, ""The main demand is for Rs 100 and Rs 50 notes and there is lack of these notes at the fish landing areas in the district. Many fisherwomen were able to exchange the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, but in turn they got only Rs 2,000 notes which are useless as of now for the trade.""    Furthermore, he said, ""On normal days, you have around 10-15 tonnes landing at the fishing harbour, but now only 5-6 tonnes is coming in. Due to the low loads the prices should actually have been higher, but as there is no lower denominations, nobody is buying. Even dry fish rates have dropped from the normal Rs 50-60 per kilo to Rs 30-35 per kg.""    Concurring that lack of lower denominations was hurting the fishing industry which usually witnesses a turnover of around Rs 4 crore per day in the district, Visakha Dolphin Boat Owners Association president Ch Satyanarayana Murthy said, ""Nobody has lower denominations in the market. Whatever fish is coming in is not being sold and even if the fisherfolk are able to sell it, they are getting very low rates. The unsold fish are being dried. Boat owners are also facing huge problems because of restrictions on cash withdrawals. While the literate people can use RTGS for money transfer to fuel the boats, the others are not able to do it. More than 90 per cent of the boats are in the jetty because nobody has the required money to go to the sea.""

Claiming that information about scrapping of high denomination notes was ""leaked"", they demanded the constitution of a joint parliamentary committee to examine the alleged breach of secrecy .    Opening the opposition attack, Congress's Anand Sharma said housewives queueing up at banks and ATMs could not be seen as holders of black money and criticised the government for seeking to tar all critics of demonetisation as ""anti-national"". He claimed BJP had been reduced to parroting PM Modi's lines.    BSP chief Mayawati said the government was attacking opposition parties in order to hide its own failures.She said her party was a movement that collected funds from common people and not from millionaires or overseas patrons. SP's Ram Gopal Yadav warned that BJP would face the wrath of its core voters.    Responding to the opposition, ministers Piyush Goyal and Venkaiah Naidu mounted a strong defence, ruling out any concession by way of allowing use of old currency beyond the permitted excep tions. Goyal said the bold decision forcefully buries allegations that the Modi government was for big business while Naidu said people were willing to put up with some pain for future gain.    Goyal said demonetisation showed that if anyone had the strength to take on black money and corruption, it was the Modi government. He added that initial difficulties were due to the need for secrecy.    No honest taxpayer would lose a single rupee while those with unaccounted wealth and terror organisations thriving on extortion would suffer, said Goyal. CPM's Sitaram Yechury supported the action ag ainst black money , but said only 6% of such money in India is in cash. He added that demonetisation would not curb illicit wealth. Raising doubts whether the government move would put an end to black money , Yechury said, ""The PM is cleaning the pond to kill the crocodile. Crocodiles can survive outside water, but small fish are dying... It is no longer Jai Hind, PM appears in ads and says Jio Hind.""    Congress's Pramod Tiwari caused a mini-flutter by stating that Modi has joined the league of leaders like Hitler, Mussolini and Gaddafi who also demonetised currency in their country . ""No civilised nation has done this,"" he said, causing an immediate protest from Ravi Shankar Prasad.    Earlier, Anand Sharma wondered why the government has turned 86% of currency illegal when by its own admission only 0.02% currency notes are fake. ""This is some kind of an undeclared Emergency ,"" he said.    Mayawati said the PM had not undertaken sufficient measures during the 10 months of preparation for demonetisation to ensure that people did not suffer. She alleged the government took all this time to channelise the high-value currency notes of BJP and to give a hint to the rich to take care of their deposits. Rival SP's Ram Gopal Yadav said the situation is worse than Emergency when at least food was available.    JD (U) member Sharad Yadav said demonetisation has resulted in distress sale of paddy in villages and farmers are unable to buy seeds and fertilisers.    Maintaining that the country is tired of Modi's theatrics, be it his claim that he renounced his family to serve the nation or that people want to kill him, Sharma said, ""He changes clothes five times a day and says he has renounced everything.

Nigar Sultana's son tried to get the promised Rs 4,000 for four days. Failure brought his mother, a resident of Old Delhi, to the bank on Wednesday . After four hours in the line, the 54-year-old said, ""I was forced to come here today because we now need cash urgently . This is despite my health not allowing me to stand like this for long hours.""    The day brought new frustrations for expectant people like her. Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) directive on using indelible ink to mark the fingers of those availing the exchange meant that many banks did not supply the acceptable currency notes for lack of the ink.    The Central Bank of India branch in Gulmohar Park, for one, had many complainants, many of whom pleaded in vain with the bank volunteers to relax the rule. There were few who could triumph in their inked finger, among them a handful at Jor Bagh's Dena Bank.    Under the circumstances, people continued to be denied their money . Vinod Kumar, a youngster who works in a south Delhi restaurant, began his stake out at the SBI branch at Old JNU Campus at 6am, desperate and determined after having failed to get any cash there on three earlier days or at two other banks in the locality.

152,"KANPUR: The demonetisation, which has also effected the farming practices, may result in a hike in wheat prices in future.    Farmers are unable to purchase seeds, necessary fertilizers and other important things in absence of lower denomination currency notes, delaying the sowing of wheat crop. And the delay may bring a rise in wheat rates ultimately increasing the prices of various food items.    In north India the best time to sow wheat crop is from November 1 to 10 and if it is delayed till December 10 then both the quality and yield get affected.    ""This is the perfect time to sow seeds for wheat crop to yield the best quality but as we have no money in lower denomination currency notes it would be delayed. The delay will result in bad quality and low yield,"" said farmer Dhram Singh, a resident of Gagan Kheda village, Sarsaul, Kanpur.    ""Though one can sow wheat crop till December 15 but the prime time is between November 1 and November 20. The productivity in such land where seeds will be sown late will degrade. On every one acre of land there would be a loss of five to seven quintals of the crop,' he added.    Another elderly farmer of the same village, Surendra Singh Yadav said, ""We dont have new currency notes to buy seeds and fertilizers to sow wheat crop. We are getting only old currency notes from wholesalers by selling seasonal vegetables With the limit of only Rs 4,000 to exchange at a time and now indelible ink, how will we exchange big amount which is required when ATMs too are dispensing only Rs. 2000 that too after struggling for entire day.""    Agriculture experts have also claimed that demonetization will certainly affect the agriculture cycle which is totally depended on perfect timing of sowing crops.    Dr Karam Hussian from Agronomy department of Chandra Shekhar Azad Univeristy of agriculture and technology said at present there is a decline in the purchase of seeds from the seed store of university. From a sale of three lakh rupees per day of seeds, it has come down to around one lakh. Also If wheat is sown in December month, there would be a decline of 10 to 12 quintal of crop per acres, he added.    He also advised farmers to increase the quantity of seeds for sowing and do proper irrigation if they sow seeds in December.

153,"MUMBAI: The money flooding into banks as people rush to deposit Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has resulted in such a massive bonanza that it's pulling rates down, bankers said. Thus the longstanding complaint of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that banks weren't passing on rate reductions may be addressed soon.    Banks ran out of currency in the Capital and elsewhere, although some cities reported that queues had shortened. In Parliament, the opposition parties attacked the government over the withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, saying it was insensitive, caused hardship to people and had unleashed ""economic anarchy"".    State Bank of India (SBI) reduced rates on deposits from one year to 455 days to 6.90%, down 15 basis points, while keeping the 7% rate for deposits between 211 days to one year unchanged. That may not be great news for those putting their money in banks but lending rates are likely to follow suit in a few weeks, possibly giving sluggish credit expansion a much-needed boost and shoring up growth. Abasis point is 0.01percentage point.    ""All rates will fall,"" said SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya. ""The bank has seen huge inflow of deposits but demand for credit has slowed down. Therefore, lending rates too will fall but after a gap.""    Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 were being scrapped from November 9 as part of the push against black money, counterfeiting and corruption, it's estimated that the banks have collected deposits worth a total Rs 4 lakh crore. To put that number in perspective, the government told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that it expected close to Rs 10 lakh crore to be deposited in banks by the end of December 30, which is when they will stop exchanging the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Deposits collected by State Bank of India and its five associate banks amounted to Rs 1 lakh crore until Wednesday.    SBI and its units make up about a fourth of the banking system. Among private banks, Axis Bank took the lead by cutting lending rates by 15-20 basis points.    The bank will charge 9.05% on one-year loan, which is higher than 8.90% by SBI, the country's largest bank.    Executives at Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda and Bank of India told ET they would be looking at cutting deposit rates soon.    According to RBI data, total deposits in the system are close to Rs 100 lakh crore. A Rs 4 lakh crore addition to this base is equivalent to the cash reserve ratio, the slice of deposits that banks have to park with the central bank.    ""This kind of deposit collection is as good as a cut in CRR by 4% and this will lead to interest rate transmission without a cut in policy rates,"" said R Marathe, managing director and CEO of Bank of Maharashtra.    CRR is currently at 4%. In the past few years, RBI has nudged banks several times to pass on cuts in key rates to end customers.    Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan made the point repeatedly during his tenure.    Shubhada Rao, chief economist, Yes Bank, said: ""We expect banks to reduce deposit rates by 75-100 bps over the next six-nine months. The new regime of MCLR will immediately take into account the lower cost and will thereby lead to a decline in lending rates and improved transmission.""

They have urged that demonetised currency be allowed beyond November 24, until swipe machines are in place at monuments and museums. They also want the exchange ceiling to be relaxed for foreign tourists and have suggested that scrapped notes be accepted for road tax by state governments.

At a public hearing organised at Azadpur Mandi, Kejriwal and Banerjee spoke at length about the problems being faced by the common man due to the scrapping of the old 500 and 1,000 notes.

Bill Gates+  was zipping around in a phut phut (modified three-wheeler) for a virtual reality film being shot on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.    Since 2002, when it started operations in India, the foundation has invested $1 billion in India. It's looking to do much more in the country. ""I am very optimistic on India. Even if one of my ideas contributes to making a difference to the lives of 1.3 billion Indians, it will be huge for me,"" Gates told TOI in an exclusive interaction.    He was referring to the ideas he shared during his lecture on technology for transformation at Niti Ayog on Wednesday. The lecture was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,  finance minister Arun Jaitley+  along with other ministers and top officials.    Gates believes digital payments can transform the lives of poor, and if  demonetisation+  helps quicken digitisation, the temporary pains may be worth going through.    ""Government transitions are never managed perfectly and never easy,"" he said, referring to the transitory problems caused by the replacement of high-value currency notes.    ""India is pushing towards digitisation in a big way.

His foundation is working with California Institute of Technology to develop what he calls a ""reinvented toilet"" that will dispose of waste without the toilet being connected to a sewage system.

The event was held at Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA), Civil Lines, on Wednesday.    This, Srinivas said, will happen because a large sum of money has been removed from circulation, inhibiting purchases of fast moving consumer goods, which are usually purchased in hard cash. Srinivas, along with economist and chartered accountant Tejinder Singh Rawal, explained the implications of demonetization to students, professionals and businessmen present at the discussion.    He also said, ""The movement of currency has stopped after demonetization, which is slowing the economy down."" Workers in the steel, aluminium, construction and real estate sectors are not getting paid and as a result work in these sectors has stopped, said Srinivas.    Highlighting the benefits of this slowdown, Srinivas opined that current scenarios are favourable for buying real estate and automobiles, since RBI has slashed repo rates to the banks. However, he cautioned that this benefit can only be availed if banks are willing to pass it down to consumers. He also cautioned against buying land as an investment since there will be no returns.    Srinivas spoke briefly about the impact the recent US presidential elections will have on world economy. He said, ""US contributes to 23% of the world GDP and because its share is the highest of any other country, the current political instability there will have severe consequences on global economy.""    Rawal believes it was inevitable that a large section of the society will face problems after demonetization since they have never used banking services. Those who were able to exchange their old notes will hoard new currency until they are confident that enough money is in circulation for them to use the highest denomination, which was recently issued, said Rawal.    Whether we can become a cashless economy was the topic Rawal touched upon and said, ""With Jan Dhan Yojna, the government has made an effort to open as many bank accounts in rural areas as possible. But it will still take a lot of time to transition over to a cashless system.""    Rawal also pointed out that money held by the common man will see its value appreciate, since most of the unaccounted wealth is now deemed redundant. ""Approximately Rs400 crore was in circulation before demonetization which was affecting the economy badly. Now, since that money is no longer of any value, the legitimately acquired cash will gain more value than before,"" said Rawal.

163,"THANE: The gloom over the realty sector appears to have intensified following the demonetisation process which has shaken the confidence of consumers in the resale property market.    Members from the Thane real estate association claim that high uncertainty prevails as buyers prefer to wait and watch the market due to which transactions and sales have come to an almost standstill since last week.    The resale transactions comprise of nearly 25% of all the real estate deals inked in the lake city and business is centred in the old city areas like Naupada, Panchpakhadi, Khopat, Kopri,Vasant Vihar and even Ghodbunder Road.    ""Barely any resale flat deals have reached the final stage since the announcement of high value demonetization was made on November 8. The segment was always driven by a notable cash component. Now, it would be almost impossible for such deals to be carried out unless either of the parties take a risk. Few deals that were made before the announcement are also being postponed or brought again to the negotiating table,"" said Rajesh Gadgil, president of the real estate association at Thane.    The buying and selling of flats involves part black and part white payment components. The deals are usually done with 60% white and 40% black to avoid capital gains on properties, say experts. With the demonetization of such high value notes, it has become a sticky terrain for both sellers and buyers and both are opting to wait and watch before inking their respective deals.    Meanwhile, buyers are also sceptical of the fate of such properties whose rates could possibly tumble down if the demonetization plan works out in the long run.    The eleven registrar offices across Thane also saw footfalls over the last one week but the real impact, say officials, will be seen in the next fortnight as parties that finalize a deal take at least a week or more to come and register them. ""The low turnout at offices could possibly be because of the lull after the festive season. We expect to get a correct impact of the demonetization only by month end,"" said a state revenue officer.    In addition, experts fear that the rental market will also suffer an impact where a notable volume of transaction often happens through cash. The volume of distress sales, though low, is likely to happen with sellers ready to forsake nearly 25-30%. Even few rookie investors might end up panicked and try to dispose off their properties and absorb a loss of few lakhs, observe experts.    ""Those who want to urgently dispose their properties either to migrate or to meet any other personal financial requirements might be ready to sell at lesser than the market rates. We are getting few requests for such properties of late. A large segment will however wait and watch,"" said a real estate agent from the city.    Experts, however, feel that the situation would end up cleansing the system of non-serious players. ""Sales driven by the salaried class with limited cash involvement would not suffer. We are very likely to see a clean-up of non-serious players due to this 'surgical strike' on the parallel economy,"" said Anuj Puri, chairman and country head of Jones Lang Lasalle, India, about the repercussions of the demonetization on the real estate industry.

The number of tourists recorded by the forest department this year was only six lakh against the footfall of nine lakh in 2015, registering a 33% drop in footfall. The Junagadh district administration and forest department had expected a greater rush at the five-day annual 'Lili Parikrama' around Mount Girnar, which began from November 11.    ""We were prepared for a footfall of around 10 lakh, but when the parikrama ended we recorded only six lakh. This was a considerable drop compared to last year's nine lakh,"" said Senthil Kumaran, deputy conservator of forest, Junagadh.    ""We have been told that there are two main reasons for the drop in footfall. One is that sowing is going on in the fields, and the second is the probable effect of demonetisation,"" said Kumaran. ""The non-availability of notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 kept away tourists from other parts of the state,"" he added.

Almost the entire state will vote in the elections for 206 nagar panchayats, 15 municipal corporations, 26 zilla parishads and 297 panchayat samitis between November 2016 and March 2017.    The BJP had planned a rout of the Congress and the NCP. Both have traditionally dominated local politics in panchayats and councils. However, the Centre's decision to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has changed the mood of the political campaign in the state.    Sensing the resentment against the government and the BJP, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis pleaded with the people to 'bear with the suffering'.

That slow pace, which has no doubt played a key role in exacerbating public anxiety, has got something to do with the machines needing new parts that are in short supply and are now being rushed to India, said a senior official. These are being purchased from China, the official said.    The magnetic component and the hardware, also known as magnetic spacer and wedge, are not in stock. Once we have the supplies, it should not take more than a week to get all ATMs running. State Bank of India chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said, however, that not all machines need these parts.

169,"JAIPUR: Demonetisation may have caused hardships to scores of people, but it also helped Rajasthan AntiTerrorist Squad (ATS) in identifying the alleged Islamic State (IS) fundraiser, Jamil Ahmed, while he was standing in a queue outside a bank in Fatehpur in Sikar district to convert notes to travel to Mumbai.    Superintendent of police (ATS) Vikas Kumar said that the IS operative was planning to travel to Dubai via Mumbai on November 17. But the ATS team contacted Ahmed on Wednesday, and posing as a passport officer, Kumar asked Ahmed to come to his `office' for qu estioning on account of some discrepancies in the documents of his children.Subsequently, ATS nabbed him and took him to Jaipur for further questioning.    ""The initial interrogation revealed that Ahmed had become a trusted fundraiser for IS commanders.He was familiar with hawala transit routes, which enabled him to deliver money to IS-held areas thro ugh Lebanon and Turkey,"" Vikas Kumar told TOI.    On Thursday afternoon, after a local court sent Ahmed on a seven-day remand, a field team of ATS landed in Mumbai to question Ahmed's family. To ATS' surprise, Ahmed had accumulated properties to the tune of Rs 5 crore in Mumbai.

170,"The strike was surgical, even if the post-operative complications continue to be messy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's shock announcement of demonetisation of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes established one thing for sure - that he is capable of big, bold, risky moves.    When 86% of the currency in circulation becomes illegal virtually overnight, pain is inevitable. Given the cause that is at stake, there are many who look upon the inconvenience as a necessary price to pay, while others take a less generous view. For the poor, who have little access to alternative mechanisms of payment, the problem becomes a difficult one. The government also believes that this will hasten the shift to a cashless economy, making life easier and transparent.    While there is some debate about whether this move will produce desired results or it will backfire, there is another aspect of this situation that needs more reflection - the nature of the relationship we enjoy with cash. Cash is not merely a symbolic representation of value. Cash is the idea of value captured and owned. Sitting on a pile of cash gives pleasure both metaphorical and real. Cash is not preferred only by those who have avoided paying taxes; it is the instrument of choice for the country at large. This is why retail establishments across the country are facing a shrinking of demand; in theory, for most of these outlets, customers should be unaffected given an easy access to credit and debit cards.    With cash, value has a permanent residence, it 'settles down' with its owner, even if its role is to be in a state of constant circulation. Cash is not merely money in physical form, it changes the way we regard and spend it. It is easier, for instance, to spend money using a credit card, for the outflow seems more theoretical than it does when paying in cash. The difference between Rs 2,000 and Rs 20,000 is a slip of the pen in one case and a complex exercise involving withdrawing money from the bank, carrying it in one's wallet and counting it (twice) before handing it over. The tangibleness of cash is mirrored by the continuing need felt by many for one's passbook to be updated by pen and ink.    Earning money needs to be signified concretely. Those whose life's earnings are in the form of a few high-value currency notes, do not decode demonetisation in quite the same way as those used to money in its conceptual form. The idea that it is possible to delegitimise their life's labour is to shake the foundations on which one's life is constructed.    The talk of 'cashless' is easy, but it ignores that there is a cultural dimension to the physicality of cash. Digital wallets operate on a transfer of intention, where a promise to pay gets converted into an intention to buy. For this to work at scale, one needs to have become comfortable with the idea of surplus and develop the confidence that money will come without having to struggle or having to think about it all the time. One needs to develop trust in institutions, in a context where the evidence around is to the contrary. The reason why even in e-commerce, the innovation that unlocked the market was Cash On Delivery, is that even today there exists great anxiety about thinking of money in terms of a flicker of intention. Cash gives the individual control over value, it allows a transaction to sigh with satisfaction as it gets completed.    Psychologically, money works on a convention of mutual deception. We agree to call something money, and that is good enough. But to have the thinness of this convention exposed in such a way is to cause great anxiety.    To cut off 85% of one's currency even for a few days is akin to cutting off water or petrol. And unlike water and petrol, the reintroduction of currency cannot happen overnight. Apart from all the other arguments in favour of and against this move, what needs to be acknowledged is that it will cause an undercurrent of tentativeness, one that burrows itself deep in the cultural marrow of this country. Since there is little palpable sign of how much black money exists, the success of this move will always be invisible. The uncertainty might linger. Nobody wants to fight for what is already theirs. It is almost like having to re-earn what one has already laboured to earn.    Demand to go back to normal levels might not be automatic. The idea of economic progress is not statistical, but experiential and, in that sense creating, uncertainty about money might produce the unintended effect of unsettling people in a way that alters their sense of economic well-being. In a market economy, money is the measure of everything, and the measure itself becomes wobbly, one's entire world shivers",city,jaipur,"Nov 18, 2016, 09.24 AM IST",Terror trail- Demonetisation helped ATS nab Islamic State man,1,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/Terror-trail-Demonetisation-helped-ATS-nab-Islamic-State-man/articleshow/55488758.cms,toi

""There could a probability that such a step could just come in by budget because the government is leaving no stones unturned to attack the black money economy. This would mean that the income tax officers can scrutinise those who hold cash above the limit,"" said Amit Maheshwari, Partner, Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP.    While seeking opinions of people outside Narendra Modi's core team means that the government has factored in the risk that the information could leak out, it could also be a strategy to avoid a blowback that demonetisation unleashed, experts said. The government may be looking at preparing and gauging the impact of such a step in detail by roping some consultants and senior tax officials.",entertainment,,"Updated: Feb 27, 2017, 12.41 AM IST","WATCH: Alia Bhatt's stand on Demonetisation, actress requests masses to 'be patient'",1,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/WATCH-Alia-Bhatts-stand-on-Demonetisation-actress-requests-masses-to-be-patient/articleshow/55491584.cms,toi
176,"GUWAHATI: About 25% of business in the northeast has been affected by the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, the Federation of Industry and Commerce of North Eastern Region (FINER) said on Thursday.    The slump, however, is temporary and the region's economy will benefit from the demonetization, FINER, one of the largest trade bodies in the northeast, said.    ""The construction sector and high-value goods have been hit by the demonetization in the northeast. Of the affected 25%, the construction business is the worst-hit. But we are confident that the setback is only temporary. The demonetization is going to revive the economy in the long run,"" FINER chairman Pabitra Buragohain said.    FINER, however, said it could not assess the monetary value of the total business in the region hit by demonetization.    ""Despite the setback, we have to reiterate that the demonetization is a bold move taken by the Centre. It will curb corruption and stop terror funding. So, this is going to have a long-term positive impact on the country's economy. We have to bear with the hardships in the transition phase,"" Buragohain added.    FINER has asked the Centre and state governments in the region to put in place effective mechanisms to reduce the hardships faced by people. ""There is an urgent need to improve the banking infrastructure in the northeast as we are moving towards a cashless economy,"" FINER vice president Bajrang Lohia said. ""In the northeast, there are a lot of agricultural and horticultural traders. They should be linked to the banks.

178,"MUMBAI:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi+  maintained such a deep level of secrecy in executing the decision to  demonetise two-high value denominations+  , that even the top bankers of the country had no idea about the move till he went on air at 8 pm on November 8 to announce the decision to the world.    In the first week of November,  RBI officials+  informed the chairpersons and MDs of all the top banks in India about a meeting at the central bank's headquarters in south Mumbai scheduled for 7 pm on November 8. Uncharacteristically, the RBI didn't specify any particular agenda for the meeting, two bankers said. Usually, the central bank gives some notice to bankers when they are called for a meeting since it wants them to come prepared.    On the day of the meeting, convened on the 15th floor of the RBI's Mint Street headquarters, all the top bankers of India, each with more than three decades of experience in the sector, were in attendance.    The meeting started with RBI officials mainly discussing the situation pertaining to non-performing assets in the banking sector, a hot topic for the sector till that day. They discussed some other issues related as well. Just before 8 pm, RBI officials switched on the TVs in the room. They said that the PM would be on air soon, and they would continue the discussion after his speech, the bankers told TOI.    Until the time the PM had announced that India was scrapping Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in less than four hours, none of the top bankers had any clue that the next few days would be their careers' most challenging. ""Basically it was as much of a surprise to us as to anybody else,"" said SBI chairperson  Arundhati Bhattacharya+  . After the PM ended his speech, the bankers wanted to leave immediately and start work.    ""The mood (with everyone present) was just to get out of the place and get things in place. We had to get out quickly to tell our people to switch off the ATMs by midnight; about the evacuation the next day, which was a huge exercise, then to take care of the recalibration; in the branches, what would be the instructions because there was to be exchanges, Rs 10,000 withdrawals etc,"" the SBI chief added.    However, the RBI deputy governors listed out what was expected of them and the bankers scrambled to meet their teams. The SBI chairman, along with others, left the meeting between 9.30 pm and 9.45 pm. By the time she reached her home at Malabar Hills around 10 pm, she had called some of her top officials to her bungalow. Soon enough, the meeting started and went on until the early hours.

Here's looking at a few of them...      Discounted beverages for Sonam Gupta  Since a few days, a certain Sonam Gupta has gone viral on the internet. There are tons of memes and pictures of currency notes by the elusive Sonam being circulated. However, now the joke has taken a whole new turn. Taking advantage of this situation, a few restaurants in the Capital are offering special discounts for guests who are named Sonam Gupta. So, the namesakes can take their government-issued ID proof and avail a free drink or a discount on    the bill.  Man sent to prison afterex-wife refuses to accept banned currency notes as alimony  A 70-year-old from Kolkata landed in jail after he paid his former spouse alimony in banned currency notes. The man, Bijoy Seal, had to pay his ex-wife `8,000 every month as per the court's order. However, he hadn't paid her any money in the last four years. In November, he took loans and paid the entire amount in court. But, the notes had got banned by then. His    ex-wife stated that she would only accept new currency notes of `500 and `2,000 and also refused to accept payment via cheque. He was jailed.      Woman goes topless after standing in an ATM queue for hours      Frustrated after standing in a queue at an ATM for many hours, a young woman in New Delhi took off her T-shirt as a mark to protest against the shortage of currency notes all over the country. As bystanders stood shocked, a team of women police officers arrived from the nearby police station and took her with them.      Number of thefts halved      Increased surveillance by the railway police guards to keep a watch on hoarders transporting stashed `500 and `1000 notes, has led to a considerable drop in the number of theft cases. According to Government Railway Police (GRP) this is due to demonetisation. While earlier, 12 to 15 incidents were reported, now they have started receiving only six cases a day. Reportedly, overall robbery at railway stations has dropped by a massive 50 per cent  these include pickpocketing and bag lifting.

180,"TV shows often incorporate themes of festivals and wedding in their tracks. This time, they have shifted their gaze to the demonetisation move that has gripped the entire nation. It has become a talking point on the small screen where almost every channel has shows with plots highlighting the plight of the common man.  'May I Come In Madam?'  Sajan (Sandeep Aanand) plays a common man in the show, who has never seen a wad of notes in his life. But he is stuck in a situation where he ends up with many `500 and 1000 notes and does not know what to do with them now.  'Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah'  Jethalal (Dilip Joshi) is left with lakhs of rupees and starts panicking as he doesn't know how to dispose off the money. Similar situations will arise for other characters, too, in the show.  'Zindagi Ki Mahek'  Harish (Ajiz Quarshi) has a huge suitcase filled with `500 and 1000 notes. Karuna (Rajshree Feem), who is equally worried, suggests distributing the money to beggars.  'Chidiya Ghar'  The three lead characters  Ghotak (Paresh Ganatra), Kapi (Saransh Verma) and Gomukh (Sumit Arora)  will get anxious as they will have to think of ways of how to deposit money in the bank after being left with lakhs of rupees. In some situations, it will be the boss blackmailing the employee that if he does not help him dispose off the money, the employee won't get promotion or someone else will be left with lakhs of rupees as a gift even after the latter denies to accept so much money in cash.  'Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hai'  Angoori bhabhi goes to the market with a `500 note and she has to come back empty-handed as no one accepts it. Her husband Manmohan Tiwari (Rohitashv Gaud) almost faints when he comes to know of the new rule, because he also has money stocked in his house.  'Devanshi'  The little girl Devanshi (Kashvi Kothari) goes to the market to buy a pair of silver shoes and is disappointed that her `500 note is not accepted as a result of the new rule. Later, a shopkeeper explains to her that she needs to deposit that money in the bank.  'Thapki...Pyar Ki'  Sehban Azim, who has entered the show recently, is a rich man and flaunts his wealth by waving a large wad of notes. Surprisingly, the demonetisation rule does not shock him as he feels it will not make any difference to him.

181,"GURGAON: With limited access to banking, plastic money and mobile wallets, the unorganised sector has borne the brunt of the government's demonetisation drive. And because the effects are not immediately visible except to the sufferer, there is a wall of silence surrounding it. From the local vegetable seller to the petty cloth merchant, the potter and the sweetmeat seller, everyone claimed having faced a 30-60% fall in daily business.    ""Business has been hit by almost 50%, as customers do not have cash. The few that do come, arrive with the new Rs 2,000  evidently to get scarce small change  and we just have to turn them away,"" said Shri Ram, 66, a garment shop owner in Sadar Bazar, Gurgaon.    Shri Ram has a credit card swipe machine, but given that usually, 75% of his payments are in cash, business has been badly hit.    Just metres away, Altaf, 38, who sells trinkets and cheap copycat watches in a by-lane of Sadar Bazar, said his sales, too, have plummeted 50%. He admitted he hasn't earned much in the past week. ""I didn't have cash to buy more stock. I'm just trying to sell whatever I have, and that too is also not selling.""    However, even in times of difficulty, some petty businessmen are keeping their hopes alive. Ram Kumar, 48, the owner of Sach Bhojanalaya, a small dhaba near Sukhrali, thinks it is a little inconvenience for a greater cause. When people tried to pay with old Rs 500 notes, he said he waived off the payment. He's also maintaining a ledger of people who he has been feeding on credit.    Vinod Kumar, vegetable seller, Sikandarpur    With very little work, Vinod Kumar, 31, sits on a makeshift pedestal, ruing the fact that from buying vegetables worth Rs 10,000, from the wholesale dealer, he's down to buying stock worth Rs 3-4,000 daily. ""Few people are visiting the market, and those who do, buy little,"" he says. Right after demonetisation, he managed to dump his stock of old currency at the wholesale mandi, but they have stopped taking those now. Nowadays, he spends most of his time chatting with his friend. ""My world came crashing down on the November 9,"" says Kumar.    Pawan Poorwal, clothes vendor, Sadar Bazar    Standing in front of his cart stacked with cheap denims in busy Sadar Bazar, Pawan Poorwal, 33, is zealously trying to convince a customer to buy a pair. The customer walks away. Poorwal screams ""Rs 300"", a discount of Rs 200. The customer doesn't turn back. Poorwal says he's finding it hard to sell enough for sustenance. ""People will fend for food first. No one wants to buy clothes,"" he says. Poorwal says his sales have fallen by 60%. ""I'm from Kanpur. I send money to my family. How'll I look after them?"" he asks.    Deepanshu Aggarwal, sweetmeat shop owner, Sadar Bazar    Deepanshu Aggarwal, 27, runs a sweetmeat shop in the heart of Sadar Bazar. His main concern is the inability to tender change when people show up with a new Rs 2,000 note. His business has been affected marginally. ""I deposited Rs 50,000, some of which belonged to my eight employees,"" he said. ""If they go and stand in queue, who will work here?"" Aggarwal, a young entrepreneur, is hopeful the government's move will reduce fake currency. For now, his suppliers have been generous enough to give him credit.    Rahat Khan, pottery shop owner, Sukhrahali    Khan, 32, was leisurely reading a newspaper when he was surprised by his first customer of the day. In a candid chat, Khan said his business has been badly. Earlier he used to make Rs 2,000-3,000 a day, he says, while now, he doesn't even cross Rs 1,000. He says till Saturday, he accepted old notes, but after he experienced his first queue at a bank, he stopped. He says, ""I manage daily expenses with the small change I make. But kids' school fees, shop and house rents are all pending, and I don't really know how I'll manage.""    Raj Kumar, fruit shop onwer, Krishna Market    Raj Kumar, 25, says his sales have been hit by 60%. A look at the deserted fruit and vegetable market validates his claim. ""From Rs 7,000-8,000 a day, I now make Rs 2,000. My regular customers are using cards to buy online or from big stores,"" said Kumar. Home expenses are being managed on credit, as he can't shut shop to stand in a bank queue. He added many customers are trying to use old currency, but Kumar has decided to decline such offers.",tv,,"Nov 19, 2016, 01.00 AM IST",Cashing in on demonetisation,0,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/Cashing-in-on-demonetisation/articleshow/55496028.cms,toi
182,"KOLKATA: If long queues outside banks have become a part of our collective visual consciousness, here is a group of researchers who are studying every parameter of these queues so that they can quantify the phenomenon, add value to it and submit a report to the finance ministry about the loss vis-a-vis the national gain. The Institute of Cost Accountants of India (ICAI), headquartered in the city, has started the research and is likely to come up with the report before the year-end.    The institute feels the demonetization may cause inconvenience for the public in the short run, but the move will rake in a lot of undeclared cash. Once the institute arrives at a figure (gap analysis) for the loss, not only will it be weighed against the total value that the banks have gained during this period but also how long it will take for the economy to make up for this loss.    ""With so many people staying off work to queue up at the banks, it is obvious that there will be a huge loss. But is that more than the amount that was part of the parallel economy so long and is now being banked? We are trying to find out,"" said Manash Kumar Thakur, President of ICAI.    ""If we find through our study that this loss of man-hours can be made up in the next four to five years, we will advise the government to go for another financial reform on similar lines in five years. Every modern economy should go through such repeated reformatory measures every four to five years,"" he said.    In India, the first such step was taken in 1965 and then again in 1978. ""Thereafter, it took 38 years for the Centre to come up with such a tough measure. That is the reason why black money spawned in India and a parallel economy ran so successfully,"" Thakur said. Already, a number of banks have declared that their interest rates on fixed deposits have been slashed, though the RBI is yet to go for a blanket directive, the Institute officials pointed out.    ""This shows that a lot of money is entering the coffers of the banks. This is actually good news because this has a direct bearing on inflation, which will definitely show a downward slide now. This will also encourage people to spend more in the market and discourage hording. The ultimate result will be appreciated by the masses because prices will also show a downward slide,"" said Biswarup Basu, secretary of ICAI.",city,gurgaon,"Nov 19, 2016, 01.16 AM IST",Unorganised sector suffers huge losses post demonetisation,-1,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/Unorganised-sector-suffers-huge-losses-post-demonetisation/articleshow/55504114.cms,toi

She struggles daily to arrange for household necessities in the absence of a banking system in her village, ever since the demonetization announcement. Despite managing to exchange some of her familys savings via a bank in distant Valpoi, the new 2,000 currency is of no help since grocery shops do not have small change for her new currency.    We have to make do with whatever groceries are left with us. We are forced to manage until new notes of 500 and more of 100 comes in, she said.    Indias cash crunch has hit the countryside the hardest as citizens residing in some of the interior villages and hinterlands do not have access to ATMs or banks.    In the tranquil villages of Dhave, Nagargao and Ustem in Sattari taluka, people are desperately waiting for currency of lower denominations as the cash crunch, post-demonetization of 500 and 1,000 notes, has put them in a tough spot.    Several other villages like Charawane, Hivere, Golauli, Khadiki in Sattari also dont have access to banking infrastructure. The nearest bank access is in suburban Valpoi for these villages, and villagers have been making a beeline for this suburb.    The queues in banks and outside the banks are serpentine, said Nagargao resident, Vishnu Paryekar Residents of all the villages around Valpoi come to exchange their money daily, and ATMs run dry immediately.    Dhave resident, Chandrakant Gaonkar said, I go to a cooperative-credit society in the neighbouring village to exchange currency, and then I have wait in queue at an ATM in Valpoi for 100 notes. Half my day is spent just doing this. How are we to run a business then?    For some, even making this journey to Valpoi is fruitless.    Ustem resident, Ashok Ustekar said that he has had to stand in a queue thrice since the demonetization announcement was made, but it is all in vain.    In desperation, I asked a friend to loan me some money to manage my expenditure, he said.    A senior citizen, Rukmini Pivulkar said that her entire day goes by in the hunt for currency, There are no public buses in this area, let alone ATMs. We have to either wait for the single bus that operates only thrice a day or try to hitch-hike a ride. Once there, waiting in the long queues to exchange money takes so much time!    Bankers in Valpoi told TOI that the amount of currency coming in is much lesser as compared to the bigger bank branches, which creates problems while dispensing money.

People are agitated because of this. We try to talk to them and somehow manage to convince them, but there remains a serious shortage of cash, said branch manager at SBI Valpoi, Sandhya Nevge.    The bigger challenge that banking staff face is briefing villagers about demonetization.

186,"Mumbai: Total deposit mobilisation by banks crossed Rs 4 lakh crore on November 14, according to the Indian Banks' Association. The amount is expected to have since gone up as State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, has seen ""demonetisation deposits"" grow from Rs 1.04 lakh crore on November 14 to Rs 1.34 lakh crore at 4pm on November 18.    According to SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, a large part of the deposits would be withdrawn as depositors get back to spending. But 10-15% of the money that citizens have been forced to deposit in banks should stay back, she said.    Speaking to TOI, Bhattacharya said that SBI has done 11 crore transactions since demonetisation and has collected deposits of Rs 1.34 lakh crore. Part of the reason for the higher number of transactions was that a large number of citizens were turning up to exchange notes, with several suspected to be repeat visitors.    According to Bhattacharya, the mechanism for exchange of notes was being misused and even though there have been issues with supply of indelible ink, the talk of using it helped a lot. ""I think about 75% of the people were not doing their own stuff. They were being used by others to change money,"" said Bhattacharya.    The SBI chief said that there was an initial panic after customers saw ATMs run dry. ""The empty ATMs were associated with a cash shortage. They did not realise that there are logistics issues and a need to recalibrate the machines,"" said Bhattacharya. She added that ATMs are today playing a pivotal role in banking.    ""There is no shortage of Rs 100 notes, but we have to be careful on how to give them out as they are also required in ATMs. We have given out a huge amount of Rs 100 notes, I think people are just not spending them. I have been requesting people that 'for heaven's sake, spend. The RBI is constantly printing, so supplies will continue. So please spend. If you don't spend it, it will not go around'. This is the message we are trying to send,"" said Bhattacharya.    ""Things are settling down. On an average, we used to do about 75 lakh ATM transactions daily before the demonetisation. In the last 24 hours, we have done 73 lakh transactions. So ATM transactions are sort of coming back up to speed,"" she said. Of the 44,000 ATMs of the bank, around 13,000 are already dispensing Rs 2,000 notes. With all the ATMs now being functional, things have stabilised. ""We are witnessing normal activity coming back.

The city was divided into five zones viz. east, west, north, south and central for ease of data calculation. Four questions were asked to the public to which they had to answer yes, no or can't say.    The first question asked was whether they were aware that Rs500 and Rs1000 bank notes are no longer legal tender. Everyone who was asked this question said they were aware of the move.    On the question whether they are happy with the move, 62.67% respondents replied in the affirmative while 36.06% said they are unhappy with the government's decision and 1.26% chose not to comment on the topic.

188,"Visakhapatnam: With cash crunch still persisting, cafes and coffee shops that are frequented by the young and middle-aged groups are facing a drop in business and bearing the brunt of demonetisation in the Port City.    Known for its cosmopolitan culture, Vizag has more than a dozen cafes and coffee shops at various areas such as Siripuram, Daspalla Hills, Waltair Uplands and Beach Road to name a few. Those equipped to deal with both cash and card transactions too are facing a slowdown for the past one week as the number of visitors have dropped by up to 40%.    Asked about the effect of demonetisation, Zushan Ali of The Gallery at Siripuram, said, ""Of course, we too have been affected by the shortage of cash. We are almost facing a 40% drop in business due to this. We can understand that customers are unable to visit because many of them are able to get only Rs 2,000 from their ATMs per day."" At the same time, he said, ""It's not just customers, we are also facing hurdles to pay for the day-to-day expenses at our cafe.""    Meanwhile, Sashikant Kumar of Moksha Restocafe at Daspalla Hills said, ""It has affected us a lot, not just a bit. We are down by 50% and this is generally a season for good business. Even people who have money in the bank are not willing to spend any money now and there is this whole sense of fear in the market about saving. This is affecting all the businesses. So it could take another quarter to recover from the slump.""    Pointing out that transactions through digital wallets had increased by almost 100%, he said, ""The sudden decision has affected us as we were not taking cards until now because the ATM was just below our cafe. It's the same with people, just because we are not able to take Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, we are losing customers.""    Meanwhile, Sumanth Behera, partner of Plot 17, a cafe at Gangapur Layout, said in order to offset the losses, they had resorted to providing special offers to customers wanting to pay with the old Rs 500 notes during the first three days of the demonetisation drive. ""The first three days were a bit difficult so we took Rs 500 notes and gave food worth Rs 600 to our customers. So that helped us out a bit.""

189,"NEW DELHI: Attorney general Mukul Rohatgi and senior advocate and Congress member Kapil Sibal had a 'political' spat in the Supreme Court on Friday over people's woes post-demonetisation.    Appearing for advocate petitioners who have questioned the legality of demonetisation, Sibal reeled out statistics about non-availability of cash and withdrawal limits, non-functional ATMs, cash-starved banks and long queues to drive home the point about ""shoddy handling"" of the post-demonetisation situation by the Centre.    ""India is a cash-driven economy and the government has frozen circulation of cash. All economic activity in the country has come to a standstill. People are not being able to buy anything. The government is doing nothing to ease the woes of the general public,"" he said.    Already under fire from the SC for not taking enough measures to ease harassment of people forced to stand long hours daily to withdraw cash, the AG could take no more of Sibal's accusations which echoed the tone of political parties criticising the government in Parliament and outside.    Rohatgi said, ""The statistics being reeled out by Sibal are all wrong. It is for political reasons that these petitioners are raising this issue. Common people have supported the government's decision to demonetise high value currency notes to root out black money.""    When Sibal continued to criticise the Centre, Rohatgi said, ""The government at the highest level is monitoring the situation on a daily basis and taking steps to ease the problems faced by people. The queues have started reducing in length. Mobile cash dispensing vans are being deployed before private hospitals to help patients. But a few continue to use the situation to serve their political ends.""    To drive home the point, the AG said, ""I saw Sibal's press conference (for Congress party) yesterday.

""The RBI step is enough to double farmers' troubles, whereas Modi had assured to double the income of farmers,"" said Jakhar on Friday at Bathinda.

192,"CHENNAI: When a measure like demonetisation that affects all people comes into play, you can be sure it will be factored into films in a variety of ways in the times to come. Film is a mass medium and a mass happening is certain to find echoes in it. In fact, the very first demonetisation in India that took place in 1946 figures brilliantly in a little known film of the period. The film, `Vijayalakshmi', flopped when it was released, but ironically it is perhaps the only film of 1946 to have survived 70 turbulent years since it saw the light of day.    Though named eponymously after its female protagonist, the film is dominated by the avaricious father-in-law Ganapathi Iyer, who finds his nemesis in the demonetisation of thousand rupee notes. In a superbly crafted climax that is based on superimpositions, unconventional camera angles and evocative music, the character that marries the religiosity of the priestly class with the greed of the loan shark finds superb evocation. Based on a Marathi stage play , `Bandaachi Soon', written by playwright Ganesh Krishna Shastri Pathak, Vijayalakshmi was directed by the veteran filmmaker P Pulliah, most famous for directing N T Rama Rao in the iconic mythological Sri Venkateswara Mahatyam (1960). Ironically , Vijayalakshmi is on the other end of the spectrum, being for most part a delightful vehicle of cinematic realism that presents credible characters and situations.    B R Panthulu, known more as producer director of seminal films like `Veerapandiya Kattabommon', `Kappalottiya Thamizhan', `Karnan' and Aayirathil Oruvan', if not for ` his essay of the role of `School Master', excels himself in a riveting portrayal of greed. With the varied palette of a practised actor, he brings facial expres sions, as well as mannerisms of speech and gait to make the character of the miserly Ganapathi come alive.    After his religiously conducted Lakshmi Puja, which is more a gloating over accumulated riches in his iron safe than any devotion to the goddess of wealth and prosperity , Ganapati Iyer receives a letter from his son Ramu. He begins to utter mournful cries learning that Ramu has resigned his job. Questioned by his wife, he says, `Praanan Poana Enna, Panam Poana Enna, Rendum Onnu thaanedi' (Losing money is akin to losing one's life), underlining his philosophy of life with the skewed equation that wealth equals life.    This immediately leads to exploitation and ill-treatment of women, of course with the complicity of other women, as is to be expected in a patriarchal society with scant respect for the rights or feelings of women. Prodded by his wife, Ganapati Iyer sends his daughter-in law packing to her father's place so that he can make more money getting his son married a second time. "" A two-stringed gold necklace, all the silver ware, and 10,000 as dowry for the second marriage. I can put away another 15,000 rupees in my safe,"" he chuckles happily , gloating over future acquisitions! Note hungry Ganapati is of the kind that invites the woes of demonetisation.    The year 1946 was a challenging one for the film industry with famine conditions prevailing in parts of the then Madras Presidency and the introduction of 12 ounce ration of rice. The demonetisation of 500, 1000 and 10,000 notes also hit the money bags financing the film industry as it did the stars who received part of the payment in black. Though the introduction of prohibition in eight districts of the Presidency made it seem that favourable conditions had been created for the film trade, there was actually little enthusiasm at the box office.",city,chandigarh,"Nov 19, 2016, 06.34 AM IST","Demonetisation doubling farmers troubles, not their income: Jakhar",-1,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/Demonetisation-doubling-farmers-troubles-not-their-income-Jakhar/articleshow/55504224.cms,toi

197,"MUMBAI: We queue up for hours for darshan. We hope they will bestow on us what we desperately desire, but theres no guarantees. We trade stories of other sites which might be more bountiful.    We beg their guardians to allow us access. And when we finally succeed they now put a mark, like a tilak, on our finger. Can anyone doubt that banks, and in particular ATM machines, are our new shrines and pilgrimage spots? It is quite a change from when they were first introduced in India, nearly 30 years ago. Citibank and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. (HSBC) introduced them in Bombay (now Mumbai) in September 1987 on the premises of the banks.    They only accepted cheques and dispensed cash of up to Rs 3,000 a day. An article in the Times of India in August 1987 announcing their impending introduction noted that ATMs could undertake fund transfers and other financial activities abroad but it is unlikely to be introduced in India in the near future. And for some time ATMs were likely to be restricted to big cities only.    Internationally, ATMs had been introduced exactly 20 years earlier. As with most major technologies, multiple efforts were on around the same time toward making a machine that mechanised basic banking tasks. From the 1950s, vending machines had become popular for dispensing many products in the US, UK, parts of Europe and, in particular Japan, where the 1964 Tokyo Olympics had helped showcase them to the world. Theres some evidence that a cash-dispensing machine was tried there.    But the first functioning ATM is generally agreed to have started on July 27, 1967, in Enfield, a suburb of London. Its inventor John Shepherd-Barron, whose father was the chief engineer of Chittagong port, was born in Shillong in 1925 and was later sent to Britain to be raised. His first job was with De La Rue, the famous specialist printers of banknotes, and he would eventually become managing director of its instruments division.    It is fairly obvious Shepherd-Barron would be inclined toward developing a cash-dispensing machine. But in the story he carefully developed over the years he always presented it as a streak of inspiration that hit him when he was, like Archimedes, lying in his bath. He had been just one minute too late that Saturday to cash a cheque before his bank closed and he wondered why something like a candy vending machine couldnt be modified to give out cash.    Through De La Rue he knew the management at Barclays bank, and when he presented his idea they readily agreed to support it. Instead of plastic card, Shepherd-Barrons model used vouchers printed with radioactive ink to help the machine decipher them. (He insisted the ink wasnt harmful and a user would have to eat 136,000 vouchers before it had an effect.) It required a Personal Identification Number, or PIN. (In another part of the story he always mentioned, he had made six-digit PINs before his wife said she could never remember more than four, and thats why four-digit PINs are still the norm today.)      Also read:    For many, demonetisation is a step toward equality  Shepherd-Barron ensured he got credited as the inventor of the ATM, but more comprehensive research has shown several other possible claimants. One, Luther George Simjian, actually preceded him with a machine in New York city in 1960, but this only accepted cheques and cash. It only proved popular with prostitutes and gamblers who didnt want to go into banks. This didnt help its reputation and it was discontinued.    Just a week after Shepherd-Barrons machine dispensed its first 10  which was all it gave out  a Swedish company set up a cash machine. (Sweden would also record perhaps the first major ATM theft when some enterprising criminals found a way to reuse its tokens at multiple machines.) A month later, another British bank started one, and in 1969, machines appeared independently in the UK, US and Japan. While they all used different systems, in time it became apparent that plastic cards with magnetic strips were the most efficient way to access them.    These cards were among the technologies that came together around the same time to make ATMs possible.    Others were visual display units, strong steel cases, telephone networks and, much later on, software like Windows, which is still used in nearly all ATMs. But the technology faced severe problems as well. Few machines at that time were designed to operate round the clock and in the open, working in all-weather situations. Most of those early ATMs crashed continuously.    Yet banks persisted with them. Mechanised banking, if it could be made to work, had many advantages. It seemed cutting-edge, allowing banks to give their rather sedate image a high-tech gloss. In the UK, where unions were pushing to stop Saturday banking, ATMs would be one way to keep operations going, with the added hope that, over time, replacing human tellers could cut the power of the unions. In the US, ATMs were a way to reach out to the around 30% of Americans who still didnt bank  like India today, the US then still had a substantial population that operated on cash.    Customers were initially less enthusiastic. People are wary of innovation when it comes to their money and stories abounded of ATMs eating up cards and dispensing cash randomly. People were used to operating within banking hours, so the ability to take money out at any time didnt seem important.    But then they realised how even during banking hours ATMs could cut their waiting time. The ability to transact fast turned out to be as important as the ability to transact at any time. When banks were allowed to open off-branch ATMs, the geographical range of transactions also increased.    Bernardo Batiz-Lazo, a business historian and expert on cash economies, points to one overriding change that ATMs lead to. Before they came, most people thought of banks in relation to the branch they used, where the staff was familiar and trusted. ATMs helped break that link, making people realise that the brand was important, not the branch itself. Banks used this to expand the scope of their activities into other financial services, deploying staff, who would otherwise have been tied to branch banking, elsewhere. Reducing the importance of branches also helped contain real estate costs.  THE TAKEOFF  ATM installation took off toward the end of the 1970s, especially as telephone networks enabled them to be connected in an ever-increasing web.    In the US, their ease of use helped bring the large segment who operated on cash and either had no time for or were wary of bank branches slowly into the formal banking network  very much as is hoped will happen in India. Paul Volcker, one of the most notable governors of the US Federal Reserve, called them the only useful innovation in banking.    In India, their takeoff took more time. In 1999, 12 years after their introduction, there were still only around 800 ATMs in the country. But in just a few years, the number would explode, crossing 10,000 in 2003. Even more impressive, as an article in ToI that year noted, the number of daily transactions per ATM had shot up from 50 in 1999 to 140 in 2003, while cash dispensed went up from Rs1,900 crore in 1999 to Rs 57,000 crore in 2003. Slowly but surely India was getting into the ATM habit.    Banks helped by innovating in ATM placements and services. In 2004, the State Bank of India in Kochi launched a floating ATM, on a ferry plying between the jetties of Ernakulam and Vypeen in the citys huge bay. At the other end of India, SBI set up an ATM at Leh, 16,000 feet above sea level, primarily for the benefit of the armed forces.    The regularity of strikes from the intransigent unions of public sector banks increased demand for the roundthe-clock reliability of ATM services. Banks extended ATM services, offering them in multiple languages, adding bill payment, ticket payment and other financial services. A few even tried offbeat services like giving horoscopes or allowing temple donations.  THE FUTURE  This was, perhaps, a presentiment of the shrine-like status they would take in the chaos following demonetisation. But it remains to be seen if the long-term effect will be to increase or decrease their use. On the one hand, one certain consequence will be to push people from the unaccounted cash only economy to the formal banking system  and cash taking and dispensing ATMs are likely to be the prime point of interaction.    Yet the experience from abroad suggests that ATM usage can also drop off. In the US and Europe, ATM usage seems to be diminishing. According to the American Banking Association, the percentage of customers using ATMs to manage their accounts has declined from 17% in 2009 to 11% last year. Banks say that people now visit ATMs around once every two weeks, down at least once a week. Alternatives like internet and mobile banking are partly responsible for this, but above all it seems driven by a decreasing demand for cash.    Anyone whos spent time in the US will be familiar with this. Many Americans rarely carry more than $20 with them  a sum thats enough to take care of most immediate situations, while for anything else card payments will do. In Europe, in countries like Sweden, card payments are so common that cash is now rare, and most often carried by foreigners. In one Scandinavian country a series of muggings of Asians was originally thought to be racist, until the police realised that the criminals were targeting Asians simply because they were more likely to have cash.    Perhaps the one really lasting change from the current chaos in India will be in pushing us not just towards more use of plastic, but more use of plastic for small amounts. Many people with credit or debit cards tended to use them only for substantially large purchases, not least because smaller retailers didnt have card machines. But the absence of cash in the days post demonetisation has both pushed card holders to use them for small transactions, and retailers to offer the service. One telling sign in a shop said: Card payments accepted for cigarettes.    Despite the growth of cards and other payment systems, the market for cash, and ATMs to dispense it, does seem likely to remain strong in India. As experts like Batiz-Lazo point out the ratio of ATMs to population in India is still way below global norms, leaving plenty of scope to expand. Once you leave the metros, ATMs can still seem far too few and remote.    Batiz-Lazo, in an interview with ET, also pointed out that moving to plastic implies generating fees for the bank and the card company.    So who has more to gain from going cashless? Once the current chaos dies down, and financially savvy Indian customers start receiving their card statements, the fees and interest rates charged by banks are likely to become a problem. So too will the inevitable stories of people struggling with credit card debt.    Above all, notes Batiz-Lazo, the government, in its enthusiasm to drive people away from cash, and in particular black money, doesnt seem to respect the very real reasons why people remain faithful to it. These are not stupid people. They do not want to pay taxes because, among other things, there is little value for them in doing so.    Its pointless trying to make India into a cash-free and high-tax country line Sweden because people in Sweden can see the welfare state benefits they get from hightaxes (though this is increasingly in question there too). In India, where people see only crumbling infrastructure and wasteful spending, the reluctance to pay tax can be understood if not entirely condoned. The Modi government is trying to make black money, and demonetisation as a way to tackle it, a moral issue.    But in the long run, especially as the patriotic appeal of demonetisation fades, it makes more sense just to deliver better, more efficient services, giving people a logical reason to pay tax. Until that happens, cash in all its coloured forms will remain dominant in India  and so will ATMs as our mechanised monetary mandirs that mediate our access to it.",india,,"Nov 19, 2016, 09.58 AM IST",Demonetisation drive: I-T department sends notice on large cash deposits,0,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-drive-I-T-department-sends-notice-on-large-cash-deposits/articleshow/55507434.cms,toi
198,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: The scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which comprised about 86% of all cash in circulation, will put a dent in Indias growth. How big is a matter of speculation  some analysts pegged the setback at a few tenths of a percentage point, others slashed estimates by half. The most pessimistic view would possibly see India slipping back behind China and losing its title of fastest growing major economy in the world.    Brace for a slowdown in the remaining five months of FY17 as demand dries up in response to the lack of liquidity, but expect an equally strong rebound in a few quarters when the expected benefits of the move kick in, was the predominant view among analysts.      Also read:    Crisis easing, could not have done better, says Jaitley  The economy has had a heart attack this quarter, said Indranil Sen Gupta, chief India economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. We expect the impact of this to resonate for at least two quarters, impacting GDP by 50 basis points for the fiscal year.    Most put the revised number at around 7% against earlier estimates of near 8%, an optimism that had been bolstered by good monsoons and a pay commission-led consumption boost. The Indian economy expanded 7.6% in FY16. The International Monetary Fund had put FY17 growth at the same level. China is likely to grow at 6.6% in 2016 and is expected to slow to 6.2% in 2017.    HDFC Bank expects Indias GDP to grow at 7.3% versus the earlier estimate of 7.8%. CARE Ratings slashed its projection for gross value added (GVA) to 7.1-7.3% from 7.6%. Services will get hit the most in the December quarter on account of losses in trade, hotels and transport due to the volume of cash transactions involved in these activities.      Also read:    For many, demonetisation is a step toward equality  Agriculture is expected to be least impacted with the major shock being absorbed in the first two-three weeks itself as there have been issues in sales at mandis due to the cash crunch presently, CARE Ratings said in a report.    ICRA cut its growth forecast by 40 basis points. It had earlier forecast GDP and GVA to grow 7.9% and 7.7%, respectively. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.    Consumption-oriented sectors, particularly those which witness a sizable magnitude of cash transactions, such as real estate, construction, jewellery, retail, travel and tourism and trade are likely to be most affected. Cash-based transactions in the unorganised sector would also get disrupted, particularly in rural areas, said Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ICRA.    Investment bank Ambit Capital took a far bleaker view. It cut GDP growth estimates for FY17 to 3.5% from 6.8% earlier and for FY18 to 5.8% from 7.3%, even penciling in the possibility of a contraction in the ongoing third quarter.      Also read:    How Modi's currency ban turned ATMs into holy shrines overnight  Ambit said the cash crunch will paralyse economic activity in the short term. Hence, we expect GDP growth to decelerate from 6.4% in the first half of FY17 (as per Ambit estimates) to 0.5% year on year in the second half of FY17 with a distinct possibility of GDP growth contracting in the third quarter FY17.    An economist at one of the large private Indian banks said GVA growth could be as low as 7.1% with discretionary consumption to suffer a major blow due to the cash crunch. It will be a drag especially in this quarter but we expect things to normalise in the fourth quarter, the economist said.    Credit ratings firm Crisil earlier projected GDP to grow 7.5% but now expects a downside risk emanating from demonetisation.    Though we are still waiting and watching, it is almost certain that demonetisation will shave off some percentage points from the GDP, said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings & Research, a Fitch Group company. HSBC expects an impact of up to one percentage point on growth. Using the cash elasticity of GDP, we estimate that over a year, economic growth can fall by 0.7-1.0 ppt (percentage point), with the maximum impact in the immediate two quarters, which will see a large contraction in effective money supply, it said in a note.    Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said it was too early to assess the impact of demonetisation. It is too early to assume GDP will go down just because of this. The situation will ease out in next 10 to 15 days, he said at an ET Now function, while pointing out that things were improving. The deceleration will push the governments ambitions of achieving 8% growth further out of reach.    Consumption has been hit hard. Agriculture has done better this year but it will not be able to make up for this impact, said DK Joshi, chief economist at Crisil. Consumption has about a 56% weightage in GDP.    Sen Gupta said the economy can at best grow at the same pace as last year, though it is more likely it will grow somewhere around 7.4%, slower than the 7.6% registered in the fiscal year ended March 2016. The biggest blow will be borne by services sector as people conserve cash rather than spend on travel, consumption or leisure activities. Since the sector dominates the economy, this will lead to some job losses and pull GDP lower.  BIG BOOST AHEAD  While the short-term view is negative, most experts have a bullish view a year down the line from the boost to taxes and potentially lower interest rates and inflation. Ambit expects a 25-50 basis point reduction in interest rates in the second half of the current fiscal.    Since governments fiscal situation is likely to improve (with higher tax collection), GDP growth is likely to improve over time  we expect FY18 GDP growth of around 8.2% (revised up) from 8%, said Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank.    Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are also big contributors to GDP, will be hit because both payments and receipts are in cash, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings.    Overall GDP would be affected by 0.3% to 0.5%, Sabnavis said. Care had expected Indias GDP to grow at 7.8% before the monetisation was announced.    Expectations are that the sowing for the winter rabi crop will also be affected, though it is unclear on what impact the demonetisation will have on prices of foodstuff.",business,,"Nov 19, 2016, 10.00 AM IST",How ATMs became holy shrines overnight post demonetisation,1,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/How-ATMs-became-holy-shrines-overnight-post-demonetisation/articleshow/55507453.cms,toi
199,"RAIPUR: Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) has sent an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Raman Singh, pointing out that the insufficient withdrawal limit from banks fixed by the Centre was causing difficulties to the masses after demonetisation of currency.    Talking to TOI, CCI members said, ""We welcome the move of demonetisation of high-value currency notes as it will put an end to corruption, hit terror funding and counterfeiting.    This will clean up the economy and create a stable base for the rise of economy. But the problems faced by small retailors, grocery store keepers and motel owners must be addressed efficiently in the wake of the decision.""    In wake of demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, there has been a sharp drop in number of customers and overall sales across vegetable markets, grocery stores and other commercial establishments due to shortage of tender change in the capital city of Chhattisgarh.    Keeping in view the interest of these retailers, government should allow the usage of demonetised currency just as the defunct currency of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 is allowed at government hospital and petrol pumps.    Even it should be allowed in private hospitals for the convenience of patients and their family members.    Chamber members also suggested in the letter that to ease the distribution of new currency at banks, post offices and ATMs, the government should extend their distribution counters.    The appropriate counters could be certain government offices and at rural places, counters of chief executive officer at Janpad office could be brought in use.    The members also stated that the traders should not be detained for interrogation on being found with money. For time being, the trading and business in all sectors have faced a setback, which will improve in another six months.    Moreover, the payments of daily wages to small cottage industry workers and labourers have become difiicult and brought mismanagement in the business.",business,,"Updated: Nov 19, 2016, 10.08 AM IST",Demonetisation: Analysts warn of speed bumps before GDP growth rebound,-1,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Demonetisation-Analysts-warn-of-speed-bumps-before-GDP-growth-rebound/articleshow/55507506.cms,toi
200,"NEW DELHI: Minutes after demonetisation of high-denomination currency notes was announced last week, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was up in arms, criticising the move. Her contention: the common man and the poor have been inconvenienced.    That apart, her detractors say the other concern within the Trinamool Congress is a deep-rooted fear of party funds drying up. Its largely an open secret that regional political parties like TMC depend on small-time traders and other local sources for bulk of their funding largely due absence of large-scale corporate donations.    Mumbai-based Progressive Electoral Trust gave about Rs 1.5 crore to the TMC during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. That was the only corporate contribution to her party, according to a report by the Association for Democratic Reforms.    While the TMCs funding has been a bit of an unanswered riddle, Banerjee claims she raises money for the party through her artistic ventures  the sale of paintings and books.  Also Read: Over Rs 5 trillion deposited in banks  Someone must be buying her paintings. The question is who and how, is there any transparency? asked Mohammed Salim, a veteran MP of the CPM.    This ruling party of Bengal deals with raw cash...That is why, when all national parties are trying to take this issue to Parliament for a proper and serious debate, she is trying to pre-empt it.    Salim has alleged that the TMC has found a smarter way to handle its unauthorised funds by depositing them in some banks. Raiganj District Cooperative bank has received a deposit of Rs 47 crore in four days from November 9 to November 13. How does a poor place like Raiganj get so much of hard cash to deposit in banks in four days? asked Salim, the MP from Raiganj.    I have demanded an inquiry into this financial discrepancy and have been assured by people in Delhi that it will be looked into.    Political observers, however, say the West Bengal CM may stand to gain politically, despite the criticism on her stand against the crackdown on black money.  Also Read: Demonetisation is a big-black scheme: Mamata Banerjee  The main reason behind Mamatas hue and cry is her attempt to enter the national space against Modi. From that point of view, it has been a good political move, said Professor Biswanath Chakrabarty, a political analyst.    However, Trinamool Congress in popular perception is linked with chit fund scams, black money and syndicate raj. While her populism will gain the confidence of a section of marginalised class, she might lose the trust of educated urban voters.    West Bengal has become a place where instances of political control over cash rich syndicates and stories of extortion from businesses  mostly small ones  are increasingly coming to the fore.    Rajarhat, on the north-eastern fringes of Kolkata, is a case study. It accounts for over 60% of West Bengals real estate sales. This was the region that gave birth to the concept of syndicates and even gave them sanction in the garb of providing jobs. As a result, building material orders had to be mandatorily placed with the registered syndicates at prices higher than market rates.    Rajarhat has at least 200 such syndicates, also known as land losers cooperatives. While the street perception is that these syndicates switched their allegiance after the ascent of the TMC in the State, the fact is that Banerjee had to intervene amid complaints of rampant extortion demands.    Rajarhat people are telling the country how to run syndicates. If you want to stay in Trinamool Congress, you have to abstain from such extortion rackets and syndicates, Banerjee told a workers meeting.    The Income Tax Department has already zeroed in on some syndicates said to be dealing with unauthorised cash. Jan Dhan accounts, meant to financially empower the weaker sections, are being used by political parties to stash cash, a senior official of the IT department claimed.    At another level, TMC is bracing for another political fight in case the party comes under the scanner of any economic investigations. With Banerjee having raised the pitch already, TMC leader say any such move against the party would be construed an act of political revenge by the Centre.    While condemning demonetisation, she had made the point that her party had received three IT notices earlier.    According to Jay Prakash Majumdar, vice president of the BJPs Bengal unit, Banerjee is under pressure for two reasons. He said the returns filed by the TMC with the Election Commission in 2012-13 showed the party received donations of Rs 2 crore from two companies that never existed.    Her vote bank consists of people involved in fake currency note rackets, cattle smuggling and bomb making. So, they are creating pressure on her to get the Centres decision reversed, he said.    Central intelligence agencies, meanwhile, have filed reports with the Home Ministry that Banerjees attack against Modi was aimed at leveraging the frustration of people who were inconvenienced. These agencies are also trying to locate the roots of TMCs funding.    Of late, the enforcement agencies have also become cautious. After two TMC MPs were summoned by the Central Bureau of Investigation in connection with the Saradha chit-fund case, Banerjee made a huge issue, calling it political vendetta.    TMC leaders are tight-lipped about the partys funding and the impact of demonetisation on the party. Banerjee has always reacted sentimentally when she sees common people in trouble. This is the only reason behind her outrage, said Subrata Mukherjee, a senior minister.    According to a party member in the ranks, unlike frontline political parties, the TMC does not have central coffers and its funds are kept with various leaders.    We have accounts in districts and panchayat areas where we keep our party funds. Now we are waiting for directions from our leader or our general secretary. They will take the final call about cash deposits, the party member said.",city,raipur,"Updated: Nov 19, 2016, 10.15 AM IST","Chamber of commerce and Industry writes to Prime Minister, demands relaxation in demonetisation",0,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/Chamber-of-commerce-and-Industry-writes-to-Prime-Minister-demands-relaxation-in-demonetisation/articleshow/55507568.cms,toi
201,"Mumbai: The common man is inconvenienced, but demonetisation isnt bringing only brickbats for the government. Compliments are flowing in as well, from those who see gains from the pain. For many, notably the salaried who are seen among the most tax-compliant in the society, demonetisation makes people more equal, because black money that it is seeking to tackle is one of the main causes for the wide inequality in the society.    Low inflation, more affordable real estate and an outside possibility of lower tax rates as the net could become wider are among the fruits that they hope to reap in the long run.    For the first time, I feel happy for not having more wealth, said Shajala Borde (name changed), a 40-year-old Mumbai school teacher. She is agitated at her employer, who she says has wades of unaccounted cash.    How does the common man define black money?    ET interacted with a dozen salaried people across the country. The awareness level is high, but subject to some technical definitions. Any large sum (in fact, even a single untaxed rupee is black money) that is undisclosed to the tax authorities, said some of the people ET spoke to.    It can be sourced through smuggling, acts of corruption and by other illegal means, and used to fund terrorists, jewellers, builders and politicians. Most people are aware of the parallel economy, which is run on black money spoiling the prospect of the countrys true economic growth.    Many hope demonetisation to leave a big dent on it, no concrete data is available about the size of this shadow economy  estimates range from 10% to as much as 40% of GDP.    U Nandi, an IT engineer who earns close to Rs 2 lakh a month from his job at a multinational company, said the pain is worth it.    When we, the tax-compliant community, struggle in life earning our livelihood, some crooks get easy money with no tax obligation, said the 37-year-old. It is tough to bear such a yawning disparity.    Nandi said it made him angry when he saw a small roadside tea-snack seller in Chennais Ramapuram, a service hub, earning in lakhs every month, but not paying a single rupee of tax.    The PM has made me feel the taste of hard earned money, for the first time, said SK Jain, 49, a senior manager at an air conditioner company in Mumbai. He earns about Rs 1.5 lakh a month.    For many salaried people such as Jain and Nandi, small sacrifices like standing in a queue to withdraw money do not matter in the large scheme of things. Neither do they mind going to a departmental store, where they can pay by card, to buy milk, instead of the kirana shop. Most of them expect the situation to ease soon.    But they do expect problems if it doesnt before the next salary cycle starts on December 1, when the need for cash increases, to pay off monthly bills such as maid salaries, school fees and newspaper bill. Tempers do rise where there is an urgent need of cash but they cant get it due to the curbs.    In Mumbai, Dhiraj Namdev, 34, was seen arguing with a bank manager as he was in dire need of money due to a personal emergency. But, his appearance was deceptive.    I will fight difficulties for next 30 days as the evil of black money has impacted the country over 30-years, he said.    The salaried people who pay their tax are the least worried about the demonetisation, beyond the current inconvenience from the cash crunch.    People who are unable to validate their source of income will of course, be justifiably worried, said KV Karthik, partner-financial advisory services at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India, Meanwhile, a sense of citizenship duties has started prevailing with some deciding to file income tax returns and stop transactions through black money.    According to Archit Gupta, founder & CEO at ClearTax, an online tax preparation and filing platform, he is receiving many queries now on how to file income tax. These people include private tutors, gym owners, yoga teachers, beauty parlour owners, who have all earned legitimate money running in few lakhs.",india,,"Updated: Nov 19, 2016, 10.14 AM IST",Demonetisation may prove to be a big problem for Mamata Banerjee-led TMC's funding plans,1,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Demonetisation-may-prove-to-be-a-big-problem-for-Mamata-Banerjee-led-TMCs-funding-plans/articleshow/55507575.cms,toi
